        "body": "Pokmon: Detective Pikachu\ndid the thing. Those heralding HBOs The Last of Us as finally lifting the video game adaptation curse must forget Legendary Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures 2019 release, which brought the Pokmon game franchise to live-action for the first time, and to the tune of positive reviews and $430 million worldwide. (Though in fairness to the critics, most things before March 2020 are a bit of a blur.) Overflowing with Pokmon of every type, director Rob Lettermans movie would seem like an obvious candidate for a bigger, battle-heavier sequel in the vein of the games  the endings Ryan Reynolds twist be damned.\nBut years later, even after announcing a sequel before the original movies release, a Pokmon: Detective Pikachu 2 is nowhere to be seen. Is everyones favorite furry electric pal down for the count or preparing for his next battle?\nAccording to a representative for Legendary Entertainment, the project is still in active development, but they could not confirm who was currently working on it. The Pokmon Company declined to comment when Polygon asked about its involvement with the development of the film or other projects that may have spun off since the release of the first Detective Pikachu.\nIn a recent conversation for their animated series Koala Man, Detective Pikachu writers Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez suggested they were not involved, but would love to be.\nIts an ongoing conversation that is still not over to this day, Samit said, adding that the situation was complicated and involved a lot of big studio, corporate Pokmon rights things that were not privy to.\nWhen Legendary made the pre-release announcement in January 2019 that Detective Pikachu 2 was already in development, Oren Uziel, who had then written 22 Jump Street and  a draft of Sonic the Hedgehog, was the one trying to catch the perfect Pikachu sequel idea. But representatives for Uziel tell Polygon that though he wrote an outline and screenplay for the movie, he is no longer working on the film and its unclear who has taken over.\nIn 2021, Detective Pikachu star Justice Smith was not optimistic about a sequels fate.\nI would love to participate in Detective Pikachu 2, he told Inverse while promoting his HBO Max series Generation. I dont know if its going to happen. I think we have to just kind of bury our hopes. I dont think its going to happen. I really hope so though. Honestly, Im such a huge fan, who knows, who knows? I hope so.\nBut as Samit suggests, there may be larger corporate hurdles now in play. In June 2021, news broke that Netflix was in development on a live-action Pokmon series, a logical next step to the streamers relationship with The Pokmon Company, which allows previous seasons of the Pokmon anime to live on the platform. And perhaps in more seismic events, November 2022 saw Legendary Entertainment sign a worldwide film distribution partnership with Sony Pictures, ending the long run with Warner Bros. Pictures. While Legendary and WB will continue to work together on a few ongoing franchises like Dune and the Godzilla/King Kong Monster-verse, its unclear whether a Detective Pikachu 2 (which WB co-financed) would move forward in the same way or be a victim of new relationships.\nThe word everyone comes back to is hope. For Samit and Hernandez, theyd settle for just watching it in the audience.\nWhether its us or someone else that takes up the mantle, we hope it happens because we love it, Hernandez said. I think its still a TBD, but... theres hope.\nWhat the future holds for Pokmon: Detective Pikachu and fans dreaming of another round of live-action Pok-fun is unclear. But the good news is theres a new Detective Pikachu game on the horizon. Announced in [checks notes] 2019? With no updates since? Another mystery is afoot...\nNext Up In",

        "body": "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\narrives in theaters on March 31, hopefully clearing the extremely low bar set by previous D&D-themed movies. While fans of the seminal role-playing game are still a little bent out of shape by Hasbros recent spate of unforced errors, the non-gaming public seems pleasantly surprised by Sophia Lillis owlbear costume and\nMichelle Rodriguez\ns flaming axe. Now, with less than two months until the premiere, we finally know which officially licensed adventure books will tie in to the Chris Pine vehicle  Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden and the soon-to-be released anthology Keys from the Golden Vault, due out beginning Feb. 7.\nAmong the major locations from the Forgotten Realms that will be included in the upcoming movie is Revels End, a maximum-security prison located in the frozen wilds of Icewind Dale. Revels End was introduced in Rime of the Frostmaiden, and it turns out that publisher Wizards of the Coast built its towering edifice with a particular audience in mind.\nI worked with the writers, directors to come up with a location in the Forgotten Realms that would serve the needs of the movie, said Chris Perkins, game design architect for D&D, in a promotional video released on Thursday. Rime of the Frostmaiden was released in 2020, meaning that Perkins has been whispering in the ear of writers Michael Gilio, John Francis Daley, Chris McKay, and Jonathan Goldstein for some time now.\nRime of the Frostmaiden borrows from elements of psychological horror, including films like John Carpenters 1982 horror classic The Thing. Ive played a fair bit of it, and it lives up to its reputation as a mechanically challenging experience for players and Dungeon Masters alike. Revels End is an optional mid-level dungeon that players can explore, a panopticon built around a central, all-seeing tower. In that book, it gets a fancy bit of art from Titus Lunter, and a map by Stacey Allan and Will Doyle.\nA glimpse of Revels End as seen in the most recent trailer for Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\nImage: Paramount Pictures\nYou can also see a version of it breaking through the clouds in the most recent trailer for Honor Among Thieves.\nRevels End key art from Keys from the Golden Vault.\nImage:\nKent Davis\n/Wizards of the Coast\nThursdays video, also accompanied by a news release, details how Revels End will play a role in Keys from the Golden Vault. Players will receive a key from the Vault, a benevolent organization hell-bent on securing McGuffins for various reasons and secreting them away. That key, once placed into a magical music box, will relay a mission from the partys handler. Next, players will use an in-fiction map to plan their heist.\nKeys from the Golden Vault will be filled with these kinds of heists, 13 in total. In a nod to 5th editions penchant for numerology, the quest involving Revels End is titled Prisoner 13. Rime of the Frostmaiden sent players after prisoner 237, a relative newcomer in that facility, which makes me think that the eponymous prisoner number 13 has been on ice for quite a long while indeed.\nKeys from the Golden Vault is available in a few formats, including a traditional hardcover book and a Roll20 virtual tabletop supplement. Like last years Dragonlance reboot, it will also be sold as a physical/digital combo. Those who purchase the combo pack will get access to the Roll20 supplement two weeks earlier, on Feb. 7. Keys from the Golden Vault hits the street, including Amazon and your friendly local game store, on Feb. 21. The United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa will have to wait until Mar. 24.\nIf youre interested, you can download the relevant adventure from Keys from the Golden Vault for free right now on D&D Beyond, Hasbros digital companion for D&D, which it acquired in April.\nKeys from the Golden Vault\n$45\nPrices taken at time of publishing.\n$45",

        "body": "Email\nImage: Warner Bros. Animation\nStrange but true: The new DC Comics cinematic universe will begin with Frankenstein. According to James Gunn himself, the first installment of the new interconnected franchise of films, television, animation, and video games based on DC Comics characters will be Creature Commandos. And smack in the middle of our first look at the animated series is a familiar figure that looks a lot like Frankensteins monster.\nAnd thats because he just is Frankensteins monster. The DC comics universe version of the monster isnt licensed from the rights holders of Mary Shelleys Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus. But he also isnt a ripoff or an inside joke. Hes an undead being who was created 200 years ago by Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who sewed together several corpses and brought the results to life. The monster  who goes by the name Frankenstein, dont get at me in the comments  was later lost in the arctic of the DC Comics universe for a long time, and when he thawed out, he became a secret agent.\nYou see, Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus is in the public domain.\nImage: Patrick Gleason, Mick Gray, John Kalisz/DC Comics\nFrankenstein-the-monster as a character recurs surprisingly often in DC Comics, both as a one-off and more recently with his own intermittently ongoing continuity. Hes got an extra heart, for example, in case one of them gets torn out. His sword used to belong to an angel.\nHe owes his modern editorial (un)life to writer Grant Morrison, artist Doug Mahnke, and their mid-00s web of Seven Soldiers books, in which Frank battled supernatural horrors as only an undead creature with no conscience can. 2011s New 52 Reboot saw Frank re-imagined as a fully fledged agent of SHADE, the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive. Via the convergent evolution of cool and obvious ideas, hes developed something of a Hellboy-like niche.\nIts that niche that makes it possible for DC to publish him, much less for Warner Bros. to put him in an animated series. Because while Mary Shelleys Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus  in which Dr. Frankensteins monster is articulate, even erudite, and winds up frozen in the arctic  is in the public domain, Universal Pictures 1931 classic Frankenstein  in which the monster is a monosyllabic hulk who burns alive in a windmill  is not.\nAnd so Frankenstein joins the list of public-domain literary figures who are oddly significant to our modern superhero universes. Over in Marvel Comics, for example, Sherlock Holmes and Dracula are both kind of vital to X-Men continuity. Which raises a question that can only be answered by courage and daring.\nI ask the world: What brave writer and which brave artist will make Jay Gatsby an indelible part of a superhero universe? Personally, I think hed make a great Batman villain.\nNext Up In",
