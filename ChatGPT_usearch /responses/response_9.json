{"summary_text":"ChatGPT will soon function loosely like a psychic medium, allowing you to speak to dead relatives.

{"summary_text":"ChatGPT has been hailed as a technological breakthrough for its highly cohesive, human-like responses to questions and prompts. It can be used to formulate responses for customer service centres, create marketing material and even write press releases. There are already news organisations worldwide which use some form of AI to write content. But there is one practical problem with ChatGPT - its knowledge is static."},
{"summary_text":"OpenAI has launched a classifier that can distinguish between AI-written and human-written text. The company makes it very clear that its classifier is not fully reliable. Texts with less than 1,000 words are prone to be labelled incorrectly. It performs significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code."},
{"summary_text":"ChatGPT Plus will be made available first in the U.S. and other countries soon after. The tool will remain free for the general public. OpenAI said it will begin inviting people from its waitlist in the weeks ahead. The company also said it is actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs."},
{"summary_text":"OpenAI's new AI classifier is not \"fully reliable,\" the company said. The tool is unreliable on short texts or anything below 1,000 characters. Even longer texts are sometimes incorrectly labeled by the tool, OpenAI said. Still, the company dissuades people from using the tool for primary decision-making."},
