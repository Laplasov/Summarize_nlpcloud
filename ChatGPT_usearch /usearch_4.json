      "description": "Users will be relieved to see OpenAI drop the subscription fee from $42 a month to a more pocket-friendly $20. The chatbot still remains free for users.",
      "body": "SOPA Images/Getty\n\nOpen AI, the company behind the hugely popular chatbot, ChatGPT, has introduced a $20 monthly subscription plan for users, even as it continues to keep the chatbot free for most users, a press release said. The service has been introduced in the U.S. first and will be rolled out in other regions shortly.\nSee Also\nChatGPT, launched in November last year, is an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot that provides conversational responses to user queries. From questions about deep science to poetry, the chatbot seems to have mastered them all and provides responses that have vowed its over a million users.\nSuch has been the popularity of the chatbot; users have often found it hard to access the service during peak times. While Microsoft, one of the investors in the development of the technology, plans to give enterprise access to the chatbot through its Azure OpenAI services, individual users can avail of premium access directly with Open AI through its now-launched subscription plan.\nWhat does ChatGPT Plus have to offer?\nChatGPT was launched in November as a research preview so that OpenAI could learn about the system's strengths and weaknesses and seek feedback from users, the company said in its press release.\nFeedback received from its millions of users has helped OpenAI improve the chatbot through multiple updates. As users look to deploy ChatGPT for a variety of purposes ranging from brainstorming ideas to creating content or writing code, OpenAI is looking to generate some revenue from these attempts by offering premium access at $20 a month.\nFor the fee, a user can expect public access to ChatGPT even during peak times. So, no more messages about how the chatbot is at capacity or having to hold on to your query until the network congestion eases.\nMost Popular\nAlso, users can expect faster responses when they subscribe to the Plus plan and get priority access to new features and improvements.\nOpen AI charts future of chatbots\nOpenAI has also said that ChatGPT will remain accessible for users even if they do not subscribe to the Plus plan. This means that the company is using the tried and tested 'freemium' model, where a small number of users bear the cost of the entire operation. This keeps the gates open for more free users, some of whom might eventually become paid users later.\nApart from this, the company is also exploring low-cost plans and data packs that could allow users to access advanced features for a lesser fee. This is an improvement on the company's earlier plans to launch a ChatGPT Pro service that would have reportedly cost $42 a month.\nMany users then complained that the pricing would be too high since many hadn't really figured out a way to monetize ChatGPT. However, the now calibrated subscription price has also set a threshold for other chatbots that might enter the market in the future.\nNot only would they have to offer something exciting to take the sheen off ChatGPT, but the attempts at monetizing the service would also have to be around the $20-a-month benchmark that Open AI has now set.",

      "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/sell-cost-market-kindle-amazon-self-publishing-author-2023-1",
      "description": "Mark Dawson publishes his books on Kindle Direct Publishing. He shares tips and how much it costs him  from cover design to Amazon ads.",
      "body": "Mark Dawson\nis an author who runs courses for aspiring authors on his website, Self Publishing Formula, and has written more than 40 titles that made him $1.3 million in one year.\nHe told Insider finishing a book could be emotional, but, at that stage, he tries to think of it as a product and stops seeing it as something he's poured his heart and soul into.\nDawson shared his tips for authors to get their books in front of readers and make a living.\n1. Hire a professional designer to produce your book cover. Buy pre-made covers if you're on a budget.\nReaders judge books by covers, Dawson said, whether they're browsing a bookstore shelf or the Kindle Store's library.\n\"You have to remember you're in competition with books which are written by very good writers and published by professional publishing houses,\" he said. He advised authors to commission a professional designer to make sure their cover can compete.\nDawson spends around 500, or about $618, to commission a new cover for each book. He said cover designers usually produce three mock-up covers for an author to choose from, then sell the two spares for around 150, or about $185, each, a good option for authors on a tighter budget.\n2. Commission a copywriter to write your blurb. If you don't want to spend money, try using ChatGPT.\nMany authors struggle to write the blurb  the short promotional synopsis  for their book. Writing a 10,000-word novel is a different skill compared to writing a 150-word blurb, Dawson said.\nHe said he hires a local copywriter to write his, adding that \"it's not terribly expensive, but it's worth the investment.\"\nIf this is beyond your budget, Dawson suggested trying to draft your own before posting it on author forums where fellow authors can chime in with their opinions and ideas. If you don't know where to start, try using ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, to write a first draft, Dawson said.\n\"You can tell it to write a blurb about a woman who goes back to her hometown, falls in love with her high-school boyfriend and lives happily ever after. It will write a pretty good blurb based just on that kind of instruction,\" he said.\n3. Get your novel edited and proofed  readers won't put up with 'slapdash' writing.\nBy the time the reader is on the first page of an e-book, you've already persuaded them to give you a chance as an author, Dawson said.\nTypos or mistakes will lose them immediately, he said. \"It needs to be as professionally edited as a traditionally published book.\"\n\"You can't get away with slapdash products,\" he added.\nFind good editors by asking authors who they used, he suggested, or using Reedsy, a platform that connects authors with editors, cover designers, and proofreaders.\nHiring a copyeditor for a 90,000-word novel has cost Dawson around 1,000, or about $1,228, he said, while proofreaders cost slightly less.\nTo edit cheaply, he suggested trading services, such as edits, with other authors\n4. Give away freebies to build your mailing list.\nIf you write a novella that's linked to your novel, give that away for free in exchange for readers' email addresses, Dawson said.\n\"When you have the email address, that will always be the best way to reach readers in the future when you've got something new that you think they might enjoy,\" he added.\nDawson said his mailing list was his most \"powerful asset\" for promoting new books, 10 years on from when he created it. He said that, in the past, emailing 120,000 readers about a new book has secured between 10,000 and 15,000 preordered copies by release day.\n5. Think about your profit margins before investing in advertising. It's best to wait until you've written more than one book.\nOnce your cover, blurb, and story are ready, you might think advertising is the next logical step. But make sure it's worth the investment, Dawson warned.\nFor example, he said, if you sell your first book for 3.99, or about $4.90, on Kindle Direct Publishing, you make a profit of around 2.80, or about $3.44, a book after Kindle takes its 30% cut. That's not enough to invest in advertising, he said.\nIt's much easier when you have several books in a series, he said. Each person who reads the first book in Dawson's \"John Milton\" series, which includes 21 titles, gives him, on average, around $10, he estimated, because they will often go on to buy the sequels.\nOnce you've written several books in a series, you have a \"chunky margin\" to invest in advertising on Amazon or Facebook for the first book, he added.\n6. If you choose to advertise digitally, find the right audience to target.\n\"I could get a billboard at Waterloo Station in London for 5,000, and I'd have absolutely no idea what effect that has. It's just a guess,\" Dawson said.\nBut advertising on Facebook and Amazon comes with the option of filtering who sees the ads based on characteristics like gender, age, and location.\n\"You need to use the filters that are available to narrow it down to a niche. At a minimum, you probably need to know they read the kinds of books that you're writing,\" he said.\nGetting it right the first time can be a challenge, he said. If you're not making a return on your investment in ads, try tweaking the targeting until you find the right audience, Dawson said.\nFor Dawson's next book, set in his hometown of Salisbury, England, he's spending 10, or about $12.29, a day on advertisements targeted at people living within 25 miles of the city. \"That's working really well,\" he said.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

      "description": "The AI chatbot ChatGPT can generate conversational responses to questions, but how well does it do with workplace tasks?",
      "body": "ArrowRight\nNot great, but not bad, right?\nWorkers are experimenting with ChatGPT for tasks like writing emails, producing code or even completing a year-end review. The bot uses data from the internet, books and Wikipedia to produce conversational responses. But the technology isnt perfect. Our tests found that it sometimes offers responses that potentially include plagiarism, contradict itself, are factually incorrect or have grammatical errors, to name a few  all of which could be problematic at work.\nAdvertisement\nChatGPT is basically a predictive-text system, similar but better than those built into text-messaging apps on your phone, says Jacob Andreas, assistant professor at MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory who studies natural language processing. While that often produces responses that sound good, the content may have some problems, he said.\nIf you look at some of these really long ChatGPT-generated essays, its very easy to see places where it contradicts itself, he said. When you ask it to generate code, its mostly correct, but often there are bugs.\nWe wanted to know how well ChatGPT could handle everyday office tasks. Heres what we found after tests in five categories.\nResponding to messages\nWe prompted ChatGPT to respond to several different types of inbound messages.\nAdvertisement\nIn most cases, the AI produced relatively suitable responses, though most were wordy. For example, when responding to a colleague on Slack asking how my day is going, it was repetitious: @[Colleague], Thanks for asking! My day is going well, thanks for inquiring.\nThe bot often left phrases in brackets when it wasnt sure what or who it was referring to. It also assumed details that werent included in the prompt, which led to some factually incorrect statements about my job.\nIn one case, it said it couldnt complete the task, saying it doesnt have the ability to receive emails and respond to them. But when prompted by a more generic request, it produced a response.\nSurprisingly, ChatGPT was able to generate sarcasm when prompted to respond to a colleague asking if Big Tech is doing a good job.\nIdea generation\nOne way people are using generative AI is to come up with new ideas. But experts warn that people should be cautious if they use ChatGPT for this at work.\nAdvertisement\nWe dont understand the extent to which its just plagiarizing, Andreas said.\nThe possibility of plagiarism was clear when we prompted ChatGPT to develop story ideas on my beat. One pitch, in particular, was for a story idea and angle that I had already covered. Though its unclear whether the chatbot was pulling from my previous stories, others like it or just generating an idea based on other data on the internet, the fact remained: The idea was not new.\nIts good at sounding humanlike, but the actual content and ideas tend to be well-known, said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management who studies artificial intelligences impact on work. Theyre not novel insights.\nAnother idea was outdated, exploring a story that would be factually incorrect today. ChatGPT says it has limited knowledge of anything after the year 2021.\nProviding more details in the prompt led to more focused ideas. However, when I asked ChatGPT to write some quirky or fun headlines, the results were cringeworthy and some nonsensical.\nNavigating tough conversations\nEver have a co-worker who speaks too loudly while youre trying to work? Maybe your boss hosts too many meetings, cutting into your focus time?\nAdvertisement\nWe tested ChatGPT to see if it could help navigate sticky workplace situations like these. For the most part, ChatGPT produced suitable responses that could serve as great starting points for workers. However, they often were a little wordy, formulaic and in one case a complete contradiction.\nThese models dont understand anything, Rahman said. The underlying tech looks at statistical correlations  So its going to give you formulaic responses.\nA layoff memo that it produced could easily stand up and in some cases do better than notices companies have sent out in recent years. Unprompted, the bot cited current economic climate and the impact of the pandemic as reasons for the layoffs and communicated that the company understood how difficult this news may be for everyone. It suggested laid off workers would have support and resources and, as prompted, motivated the team by saying they would come out of this stronger.\nAdvertisement\nIn handling tough conversations with colleagues, the bot greeted them, gently addressed the issue and softened the delivery by saying I understand the persons intention and ended the note with a request for feedback or further discussion.\nBut in one case, when asked to tell a colleague to lower his voice on phone calls, it completely misunderstood the prompt.\nTeam communications\nWe also tested whether ChatGPT could generate team updates if we fed it key points that needed to be communicated.\nOur initial tests once again produced suitable answers, though they were formulaic and somewhat monotone. However, when we specified an excited tone, the wording became more casual and included exclamation marks. But each memo sounded very similar even after changing\nthe prompt.\nIt's both the structure of the sentence, but more so the connection of the ideas, Rahman said. Its very logical and formulaic  it resembles a high school essay.\nAdvertisement\nLike before, it made assumptions when it lacked the necessary information. It became problematic when it didnt know which pronouns to use for my colleague  an error that could signal to colleagues that either I didnt write the memo or that I dont know my team members very well.\nSelf-assessment reports\nWriting self-assessment reports at the end of the year can cause dread and anxiety for some, resulting in a review that sells themselves short.\nFeeding ChatGPT clear accomplishments, including key data points, led to a rave review of myself. The first attempt was problematic, as the initial prompt asked for a self-assessment for Danielle Abril rather than for me. This led to a third-person review that sounded like it came from Sesame Streets Elmo.\nSwitching the prompt to ask for a review for me and my accomplishments led to complimenting phrases like I consistently demonstrated a strong ability, I am always willing to go the extra mile, I have been an asset to the team, and I am proud of the contributions I have made. It also included a nod to the future: I am confident that I will continue to make valuable contributions.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the highlights were a bit generic, but overall, it was a beaming review that might serve as a good rubric. The bot produced similar results when asked to write cover letters. However, ChatGPT did have one major flub: It incorrectly assumed my job title.\nTakeaways\nSo was ChatGPT helpful for common work tasks?\nIt helped, but s",

      "body": "Posted: Feb 02, 2023 6:00 AM EST | Last Updated: 1 hour ago\nChatGPT pulls data from across the internet to respond to users' questions and commands.\n(rik Chouinard/CBC-Radio-Canada)\ncomments\nThe artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT launched in November and has already become so popular around the world that people cannot access the platform because it is routinely at capacity.\nThat's largely because people have flocked to see for themselves the tool draft emails, craft cover letters for job applications and write academic essays on Shakespeare  all from a simple prompt.\nNew Brunswick-based academics and experts said the tool can be used for both good and bad in the classroom, the workplace and indeed anywhere where someone can access the internet.\nHow does it work?\nPaul Cook, a University of New Brunswick professor who researches artificial intelligence, said ChatGPT works through prediction.\n\"It's just always predicting the next word. You give it some context, it can predict the next word. But it can predict, you know, many next words,\" he said.\nPaul Cook said he's more concerned about his students understanding the societal impacts of tools like ChatGPT than them using it to cheat in class.\n(University of New Brunswick)\n\"That's really what ChatGPT is doing. You provide some input to the model, some text, something that you write, and it generates a response.\"\nChatGPT uses a wealth of information drawn from the internet to inform its responses to questions and commands. Though the tool is not actively pulling from the internet while someone uses it, it was trained on past data and has limited knowledge of world events after 2021.\nCook said the tool was honed by having humans review and rank its responses.\nBut Cook said the tool also has limitations, one of which is that its responses can be very confident but wrong.\nWe asked an AI questions about New Brunswick. Some of the answers may surprise you\n\"[That's] also a little bit more than just a limitation, where we might start to think of it as a danger,\" Cook said.\nHe said much of the conversations around ChatGPT have focused on its impact on academia but there should also be a discussion about the tool now being available for society at large.\nHe said if someone uses the tool for amusement, it's fine if the returned text is wrong.\n\"But if you're basing some decision on the output of a language model, then there's certainly cause for concern,\" he said.\nHow educators are responding\nInitially, ChatGPT's writing skills seem quite impressive, said Andrew Moore, an associate professor in the great books department at St. Thomas University (STU).\nThen he started to notice some weaknesses.\nAndrew Moore said he was originally impressed with ChatGPT's writing abilities but after experimenting with it more, he learned of some of its weaknesses.\n(Submitted by Andrew Moore)\n\"If you are an expert on any kind of subject, and you start asking ChatGPT questions related to your area of expertise, it becomes apparent pretty quickly that it doesn't really know what it's talking about,\" Moore said.\nCook said the tool could be useful in a computer science classroom.\n\"There could be situations where it would be entirely appropriate to say, use such a tool, think critically about its output, and compare and contrast several tools,\" Cook said.\nMoore said tools like ChatGPT aren't going anywhere.\n\"We're going to adapt and probably teach students how to use them. I think that we're also going to sort of establish norms, both within schools and in the world, for legitimate and illegitimate uses of these tools.\"\nUNB will work with its staff and colleagues across the country on a consistent approach to ChatGPT and academic dishonesty, Heather Campbell, associate director of communications, said in a statement.\nAt STU, any issues will likely be dealt with at a classroom level, said Jeffrey Carleton, associate vice president of communications. He said if the use of ChatGPT becomes a prevalent issue, professors would consider policy targeting the tool.\nOpen AI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced Tuesday it had created a tool meant to detect whether an essay or homework was done with the help of AI.\nCook said he's more concerned about ensuring his students understand the societal impacts of these tools than them using ChatGPT to cheat.\nRisks and opportunities to businesses\nChatGPT creates a host of cybersecurity concerns, according to experts in the sector.\nThe easiest way to hack into a business's system is through a link in a phishing email, said David Shipley, chief executive officer of Beauceron Security in Fredericton.\nDavid Shipley said ChatGPT will make it more difficult for people to catch phishing emails.\n(Jennifer Sweet/CBC)\nWith ChatGPT, many of the tips security experts would provide businesses to protect against phishing  like looking out for poor spelling or grammar  become obsolete.\n\"We're going to see incredibly well-written phishing emails that potentially have the ability to harvest information about you that you've posted publicly, to create a compelling message unique to you,\" Shipley said.\nChatGPT could help rather than hinder student learning, says B.C. professor\nCarlos Morales, who works for the Fredericton-founded cybersecurity company Bulletproof, said another risk is ChatGPT's ability to write malware  short for malicious software.\nThere are controls in place to stop ChatGPT from creating malware, but Morales said people can ask it to create pieces of code that together can be used to make malware.\n\"That's one of the biggest concerns that we all have in the cybersecurity industry, is the potential of someone that really doesn't know how to code, well, now they can just put together some pieces of software.\"\nBut that ability to code could also help businesses, according to James Stewart, CEO of the Saint John-based TrojAI inc.\nHe said it could be used to streamline the coding process, by writing or reviewing code written by humans. And there's also the opportunity for it to be used on the customer service side, as a chatbot.\n'It's quite clever:' take a quick peek at how ChatGPT works\n13 days ago",

      "body": "Twitter\nIllustration by Zaire Diaz/The Daily Campus\nOn Feb. 1, the Writing Center organized an event to talk about teaching in the age of ChatGPT, the natural language model that has taken the mainstream by storm. Over 200 people attended the event, which was sponsored by the Humanities Institutes Digital Humanities and Media Studies Initiative, the Writing Center and the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. Professors gathered to discuss urgent concerns about course policies, practices and ethics in the era of ChatGPT. They also posed philosophical questions discussing ChatGPTs implications for thinking and language, teaching and learning and the purposes of higher education.\nProfessors shared their experiences adapting to ChatGPT in the classroom and their opinions on its use.\nProfessors at the discussion had varying views on whether or not students should be allowed to use ChatGPT in their assignments.\nAs an English professor, Yohei Igarashi does not discourage his students from utilizing ChatGPT in his class. Instead, he tells his students that they need to cite it.\nIf you dont acknowledge it, Im going to consider it plagiarism in the same way that I would if you dont acknowledge sources, Igarashi said. But I didnt prohibit them or discourage them from using it.\nIgarashi said that the problem of trying to coax original thoughts out of students has been a problem since the internet and pointed out that professors have always been able to adapt.\nI think teachers are really good at coming up with assignments that facilitate that, Igarashi said. A lot of the things we already do to make our assignments very specific still work for now with large language models and text generators like ChatGPT.\nProfessors also raised concerns about determining the boundary between utilizing ChatGPT as a tool and exploiting it for plagiarism, acknowledging that students can use it for more than just generating writing.\nSome professors are okay with students using ChatGPT as an assignment tool.\nKyle Booten, an English professor using ChatGPT as a tool for his book, hoped that ChatGPT would not be solely known to students as the thing that writes your paper for you. Instead, he and many other professors at the event expressed a desire for more people to recognize the capabilities and potential of ChatGPT.\nIt can also make writing more challenging in different ways, catalyze your thinking in ways that are unique to it, and I think theres a lot of opportunity to figure out what those ways are, Booten said.\nAlexandra Paxton, a psychology professor, believes it is a great tool to help students draft their ideas.\nAs long as theyre authentically speaking and theyre putting the intellectual effort on their own, Im fine with that, Paxton said. I want them to be sparked and interested to invest in the assignment and invest in their own ideas and thinking about their own lives, and thats not something ChatGPT can do for them.\nHowever, some professors are afraid that students would use ChatGPT to generate ideas instead of thinking for themselves.\nI think a lot of the panic is not about the particular word choices. Its that at least some students are going to use it to generate the ideas, which is the whole point of the learning exercise, Michael Morrell, a political science professor, said. Acknowledgement is not enough; I want them to at least try to do these ideas on their own.\nThere was also discussion about how bias in AI can force dominant writing styles onto marginalized people, who are usually oppressed in their writing, according to Paxton.\nIn using this as proofreading, in using this as a generator, are we whitening, masculating our voices so that people dont have authenticity? Paxton asked. How are we excluding voices from our communications and implicitly allowing undergraduates to have their own voices and authenticity removed?\nShe says that these marginalized groups may not be represented in the data that these AI models are trained on.\nThere is not equity and access to the sorts of materials that then create the data sets that are then used to create the models, Paxton said.\nOn the other hand, professor Arash Zaghi uses ChatGPT as an assistive technology for neurodiverse learners.\nThink about it as 24/7 writing assistance at their disposal, Zaghi said.\nThe event allowed for virtual or in-person attendance at the Homer Babbidge Library.\nTAGS",

The company will also continue to offer a free version of the service, which is available to only a limited number of people during peak hours.\r\n\r\nEarlier in January, OpenAI hinted at monetizing the chatbot to sustain its growth.\r\n\r\nInitially, ChatGPT Plus will be available only to users in the United States. OpenAI has started a waiting list for the service and will begin inviting people on the list to join in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nExpensive technology: OpenAIs chief executive, Sam Altman, in a recent tweet confirmed that the company is spending a lot to sustain the service.\r\n\r\nA spokeswoman for OpenAI, Hannah Wong-Silva, said the new subscription service is designed to make some of this money back while the company continues to offer a free version of the chatbot.\r\n\r\nChatGPT is the most prominent example of a new kind of chatbot that has captured the imagination of both the business world and the general public in recent weeks. Students are already using ChatGPT to write term papers. Companies are generating email messages and other marketing materials.\r\n\r\nFastest-growing application: Meanwhile, A report by UBS Research indicated that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.\r\n\r\n \tRecall that OpenAI had announced that the application reached 1 million users in the first 5 days of its launch in December last year.\r\n \tCiting data from analytics firm Similarweb, the UBS report said an average of about 13 million unique visitors had used ChatGPT per day in January, more than double the levels of December.\r\n \t\"In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,\" UBS analysts wrote in the report.\r\n",

Now, anyone who signs up for a subscription will benefit from faster response times and priority access to new features and improvements.\nHowever, the tool will still be free to the general public.\nWe love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT, the company said in a blog post.

The failures can be extremely unpredictable,\" Huang wrote in Ars Technica, the tech news website.Just like GoogleChatGPT is powered by an AI language model nearly three years old -- OpenAI's GPT-3 -- and the chatbot only uses a part of its capability.The true revolution is the humanlike chat, said Jason Davis, research professor at Syracuse University.\"It's familiar, it's conversational and guess what? It's kind of like putting in a Google search request,\" he said.ChatGPT's rockstar-like success even shocked its creators at OpenAI, which received billions in new financing from Microsoft in January.\"Given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview to StrictlyVC, a newsletter.\"We put GPT-3 out almost three years ago... so the incremental update from that to ChatGPT, I felt like should have been predictable and I want to do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that,\" he said.Altman added that the risk was startling the public and policymakers. On Tuesday, his company unveiled a tool for detecting text generated by AI amid concerns from teachers that students may rely on artificial intelligence to do their homework.What now?From lawyers to speechwriters, from coders to journalists, everyone is waiting breathlessly to feel the disruption caused by ChatGPT. OpenAI just launched a paid version of the chatbot  $20 per month for an improved and faster service.For now, officially, the first significant application of OpenAI's tech will be for Microsoft software products.Though details are scarce, most assume that ChatGPT-like capabilities will turn up on the Bing search engine and in the Office suite.ALSO READ | ChatGPT bot passes US law school exam\"Think about Microsoft Word.

      "description": "Unless youve spent your summer on a digital detox, youve probably heard of ChatGPT: the latest AI chatbot taking the world by storm.",
      "body": "January 22, 2023\nBut theres yet another question ChatGPT has thrown up: that is, whether ChatGPT could be considered an academic author.\nIt might seem far-fetched, but several papers published recently have listed ChatGPT as an author, including an editorial published in the journal Nurse Education in Practice.\nLast year, some researchers also tried to list GPT-3 as an author on a paper it wrote about itself  but they struggled with listing the authors telephone number and email, and had to ask GPT-3 if it had conflicts of interest.\nThe issue of AI authorship is now clearly on the minds of commercial academic publishers. Last week, both the Science and Nature journals declared their positions on the use of ChatGPT to generate articles.\nScience is updating its license and editorial policies to specify that text generated by ChatGPT (or any other AI tools) cannot be used in the work, nor can figures, images, or graphics be the products of such tools.\nADVERTISEMENT\nprinciples\n:\nNo LLM (large language model) tool will be accepted as a credited author on a research paper. That is because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility\nResearchers using LLM tools should document this use in the methods or acknowledgements sections. If a paper does not include these sections, the introduction or another appropriate section can be used to document the use of the LLM.\nThese are drastic steps which highlight a fast-moving issue. But why does it matter whether or not ChatGPT can author an academic paper?\nAuthorship: the currency of the academic realm\nTo understand this, its important to first understand that authorship in academia isnt the same as authorship of, say, a newspaper article.\nThats because researchers are not paid to publish papers. Theyre rewarded through successful grant applications, or through promotion, for the number of times theyre listed as an author on an academic paper (and especially if the paper is published in a prestigious journal).\nIn the academic world, authorship doesnt necessarily mean having actually written the paper  but it should, ideally, reflect genuine involvement in the research process.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCONTINUE READING BELOW\nIt also conveys responsibility for the contents of the paper. The 2018 Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research includes a guide on authorship which states:\nAll listed authors are collectively accountable for the whole research output. An individual author is directly responsible for the accuracy and integrity of their contribution to the output.\nThis raises the question: can an AI tool be held responsible for the content it produces? As an extreme example, if ChatGPTs contribution to a paper included an error that led to people dying, who would be held accountable?\nTheres also author order to consider. In most areas of research, the first-listed author is considered the lead author. Other disciplines have their own acknowledgement systems, which can include alphabetical listing.\nBut ChatGPT doesnt derive any career benefit from authorship, so where would that contribution sit within the relevant author order?\nCopyright issues\nThen there is the issue of copyright. Commercial academic publishing is a hugely profitable business that relies on authors signing over copyright to the publisher.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCONTINUE READING BELOW\nThis is a commercial arrangement. The author retains their moral right to be listed as an author and to take responsibility for their work, while the publisher charges for access to it.\nThe question of whether an AI program can own copyright is being debated. Copyright differs across the world, but traditionally has required a human to generate the work.\nThere are echoes here of a US case in which it was debated whether a monkey who took a selfie could own copyright of the image. The decision was it could not.\nBrave new world\nTheres clearly a great deal of work that will need to happen to understand how AI tools will exist in our lives in the future.\nChatGPT isnt going anywhere. Even if its banned from being acknowledged as an academic author, theres nothing to stop researchers using it in their research process. The academic community will need guidelines on how to manage this.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCONTINUE READING BELOW\nThere are interesting parallels here with the open access movement. Many discussions about ChatGPT in educational settings point to a need to move away from the traditional essay as assessment, and instead concentrate on marking students for showing their work.\nWe could see something similar in academia, where each aspect of the research is made openly available, with acknowledgement of the originator, including ChatGPT. Not only would this increase transparency, it would also reduce the over-reliance on authorship as a primary mechanism for rewarding researchers.\nWhere authorship is failing\nBecause of the value of having ones name on a paper, there has long been a concept of gift or honorary authorship.\nThis is where a persons name is added to the author list even if they didnt contribute to the paper. They may have been the person who obtained the research grant, or may have simply been added because they have a high profile and could increase the chances of the paper being published.\nTwo recent studies, one in Europe and one in Australia, reveal the level of pressure PhD and early-career researchers are under to provide gift authorship. This supervisory pressure reflects whats happening at a larger scale.\nADVERTISEMENT",

      "description": "Shore school leaders describe their reactions as worrisome and concerning as the new technology spreads among local students, but say they want to see how it can be used productively",
      "body": "\nAsbury Park Press\nWhen Meredith Heeters English classes sat down to write essays last month on Lord of the Flies, the laptops were put away, the cell phones turned off, and pen and paper were the only tools allowed.\nThats because the 22-year veteran teacher at Manasquan High School wanted to avoid any chance her senior students might utilize AI, or artificial intelligence, the growing online option that can theoretically write assignments for students.\nI felt like getting rid of the temptation to use that technology, said Heeter, who said at least one colleague in her department is following a similar approach. It is an interesting tool and this way I had more control over the authenticity of their work.\nHeeter is among hundreds of Shore educators who are reacting to what one top administrator called the explosion of AI, which other school leaders describe as worrisome and concerning.\nMore:\nHere's how more than 400 NJ school districts ranked on state Student Learning Assessments\nWhile some contend the new technology can be used productively for todays tech-savvy pupils, most are offering uncertainty as the option grows in popularity.\nStudent use of AI to complete their work is a worrisome prospect, said Charles Sampson, superintendent of the Freehold Regional High School District, which serves more than 10,000 students in six high schools. But with the technology itself, there could also be positive opportunities. Time will tell.\nBrick Township Superintendent Thomas G. Farrell offered a similar view.\nIt is very interesting yet very concerning at the same time, Farrell said via email. This will be an arduous task for teachers to develop assignments   so that simple online plagiarism can't come into play.\nThe most popular AI program is ChatGPT, a free artificial intelligence computer program that writes human-sounding answers to most questions and can produce 500-word essays explaining anything from quantum physics to plotlines of The Grapes of Wrath.\nIn the past, AI has been used largely for predictions or categorization, said Helen Lee Bouygues, president and founder of the\nReboot Foundation\n, which advocates for critical thinking to combat the rise of misinformation. ChatGPT will actually create new articles, news items or blog posts, even school essays, and its pretty hard to distinguish between them and real, human-created writing,\nMichael Citta, superintendent of Toms River Regional Schools  the Shores largest district  admitted that countering the AI programs takes more than plagiaristic reviews.\nIt seems, unfortunately, that technology and methods through which to take educational shortcuts  and the children that such tech targets  will always be 10 steps ahead of any potential response or circumvention, he said via email.\nMore:\nOpenAI\n. Its a free online tool using millions of pages of Internet writing.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company \"made ChatGPT available as a research preview to learn from real-world use, which we believe is a critical part of developing and deploying capable, safe AI systems.\"\nThe growing online option is sparking mixed reviews nationwide, with New York City and Los Angeles public schools barring ChatGPTs use.\nWhen this came out in the fall, I did hear some people who were panicking that this is the end of the essay, said Anna Muessig, associate director for professional development and instructional issues at the New Jersey Education Association, which represents thousands of state teachers. There could be drawbacks and places where a student takes the shortcut.\nBut most Monmouth and Ocean county schools are still reviewing the AI programs, with few indicating any immediate policy changes or restrictions.\nThose who spoke with the Asbury Park Press contend the technology is here to stay and needs to be utilized in positive ways if possible.\nSeveral educators compared the initial fears with similar concerns that arose when previous technologies, from calculators to search engines, convinced some that education would be seriously affected.\nI just honestly heard about ChatGPT two weeks ago or so and now I am hearing about it everywhere, said Joseph Howe, superintendent  of the Freehold Borough School District. These same concerns arose during the proliferation of Google and Wikipedia and I suspect students will learn how to use AI programs to enhance their learning the same way they have learned how to use these other tools.\nJames Stefankiewicz, superintendent of the Ocean Township School District, offered concerns, but with optimism.\nWe understand how this could be used by students in a way that is not with the best intentions, but when things like this come out we should work to embrace and utilize in our programs for both students and staff, he said.\nBack in Manasquan, Meredith Heeter said her students did well on the in-class, hand-written essay, as well as another mid-term assignment covering a string of reading assignments.\nI think I got a better product the second time, she said. They had to pay better attention.\nJoe Strupp is an award-winning journalist with 30 years experience who covers education and several local communities for APP.com and the Asbury Park Press.

The subscription plan which is available for $20 a month gets more features with general access to the platform even during peak time with a high user base. The advantages include priority access to new features and updates as well as open access to ChatGPT even during peak hours. ChatGPT Plus is now available to clients in the United States, and we will begin the process of accepting people off our waitlist in the coming weeks, the company said in a statement. The company also hinted towards launching subscription-based services in other parts of the globe soon. We plan to expand access and support to additional countries and regions soon. By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access available to as many people as possible, OpenAI added. Late last year, the public was allowed to utilise ChatGPT. Since then, the company said, millions of people have provided us with feedback, weve made several significant updates, and weve seen users find value across a range of professional use cases, including drafting and editing content, brainstorming ideas, getting assistance with programming, and learning new topics. Additionally, the company is also planning to launch the ChatGPT API waitlist. We are actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability, added the company in the statement. A new tool that enables users to distinguish between articles produced by artificial intelligence and those written by humans was just released by the startup. In conjunction with this, the US-based technology corporation Microsoft also declared that it will be collaborating with Open AI and investing a sizable sum of money in the project.

      "body": "ChatGPT creator launches subscription service for viral AI chatbot\nVitor Miranda - stock.adobe.com\nOn February 1\nBy Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN Business\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced on Wednesday it is piloting a $20 monthly subscription plan that offers users priority access to the AI chatbot even during peak times.\nThe paid plan, called ChatGPT Plus, comes two months after the tool was released publicly and quickly went viral, thanks to its ability to generate shockingly convincing essays in response to user prompts.\nMany people who wanted to test the tool have been locked out or joined the waitlist. Now, anyone who signs up for a subscription will benefit from faster response times, and priority access to new features and improvements.\nThe tool will remain free for the general public, however.\nWe love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT, the company said in a blog post. By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access availability to as many people as possible.\nChatGPT Plus will be made available first in the United States and other countries soon after, according to the company. OpenAI said it will begin inviting people from its waitlist in the weeks ahead. The company also said it is actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability.\nThe preview for ChatGPT allowed us to learn from real world use, and weve made important improvements and updates based on feedback, the company said in a statement to CNN.\nSince it was made available in late November, ChatGPT has been used to generate original essays, stories and song lyrics in response to user prompts. It has drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists. Some CEOs have even used it to write emails or do accounting work.\nWhile it has gained traction among users, it has also raised some concerns, including about inaccuracies, its potential to perpetuate biases and spread misinformation, and the ability to help students cheat.\nEarlier this week, OpenAI announced a new feature, called an AI text classifier, that allows users to check if an essay was written by a human or AI. The release came amid concerns the AI chatbot can help students and professionals generate convincing  essays. The new tool, however, is imperfect, according to the company.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n &  2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.\nArticle Topic Follows:",

      "body": "6:45\nNPR staff generated imagery using Midjourney\nComputers have been used in rocketry for half-a-century, so it's possible to think that the new AI programs could help. They struggled to grasp the basics.\nTiera Fletcher carefully read through an artificial intelligence chatbot's attempt at rocket science.\n\"That's\ntrue, that's factual,\" she said thoughtfully as she scanned the AI-generated description of one of the most fundamental equations, known simply as \"the rocket equation.\"\nThen she got to the bot's attempt to write the rocket equation itself  and stopped.\n\"No ... Mmm mmm ... it would not work,\" she said. \"It's just missing too many variables.\"\nFletcher is a professional rocket scientist and co-founder of Rocket With The Fletchers, an outreach organization. She agreed to review text and images about rocketry generated by the latest AI technology, to see whether the computer programs could provide people with the basic concepts behind what makes rockets fly.\nThe results were far from stellar. In virtually every case, ChatGPT  the recently released chatbot from the company OpenAI  failed to accurately reproduce even the most basic equations of rocketry. It wasn't the only AI program to flunk the assignment. Others that generate images could turn out designs for rocket engines that looked impressive, but would fail catastrophically if anyone actually attempted to build them.\nOpenAI did not respond to NPR's request for an interview, but on Monday it announced an upgraded version with \"improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\" A quick try by NPR suggested it may have improved, but it still introduced errors into important equations and could not answer some simple math problems.\n/ NPR staff generated text using ChatGPT/OpenAI\n/\nNPR staff generated text using ChatGPT/OpenAI\nChatGPT created authoritative-sounding text around the rocket equation, but the writing contains several errors and the equation is incorrect.\nIndependent researchers say these failures, especially in contrast to the successful use of computers for half-a-century in rocketry, reveal a fundamental problem that may put limits on the new AI programs: They simply cannot figure out the facts.\n\"There are some people that have a fantasy that we will solve the truth problem of these systems by just giving them more data,\" says Gary Marcus, an AI scientist and author of the book\nRebooting AI\nBut, Marcus says, \"They're missing something more fundamental.\"\nCalculating liftoff\nSince the 1960s, computers have been essential tools for space travel. The enormous Saturn V rockets that carried astronauts to the moon used an automatic launch sequence to guide the spacecraft into orbit. Today, rockets are still flown mainly by computers, which can monitor their complex systems and make adjustments far quicker than their human cargo.\n\"We cannot operate rockets without computers,\" says Paulo Lozano, a rocket scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Computers also play a central role in the design and testing of new rockets, allowing them to be built faster, cheaper and better. \"Computers are key,\" he says.\nOh yeah, this is a fail.\nThe latest round of artificial intelligence programs are impressive in their own right. After its release in November, ChatGPT has been tested by human users from virtually every corner of the Internet. A\ndoctor used it to generate a letter to an insurer. The media company Buzzfeed recently announced it would use the program to create personalized quizzes. And colleges and universities have raised fears of rampant cheating using the chatbot.\nIt seemed possible that AI could be used as a tool to do some basic rocket science.\n/ Left: NASA; Right: NPR staff generated imagery using Midjourney\n/\nLeft: NASA; Right: NPR staff generated imagery using Midjourney\nA real schematic of a rocket engine used by NASA's Apollo program (left), and one imagined by Midjourney's image-generating software (right). \"What are those bellows for at the bottom?\" asked Paulo Lozano, a puzzled rocket scientist.\nBut so far, ChatGPT has proven inept at reproducing even the simplest ideas in rocketry. In addition to messing up the rocket equation, it bungled concepts such as the thrust-to-weight ratio, a basic measure of the rocket's ability to fly.\n\"Oh yeah, this is a fail,\" said Lozano after spending several minutes reviewing around a half-dozen rocketry-related results.\nImage-generating programs, such as OpenAI's DALLE2, also came up short. When asked to provide a blueprint of a rocket engine, they produced complex-looking schematics that vaguely resemble rocket motors but lack things like openings for the hot gasses to come out of. Other graphics programs including those from Midjourney and Stable Diffusion produced similarly cryptic motor designs, with pipes leading nowhere and shapes that would never fly.\nI'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that\nThe strange results reveal how the programming behind the new AI is a radical departure from the sorts of programs that have been used to aid rocketry for decades, according to Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist for the AI company Hugging Face. \"The actual way that the computer works is very, very different,\" she says.\n/ NPR staff generated image using Midjourney\n/\nNPR staff generated image using Midjourney\nMidjourney's attempted to recreate the path of a rocket travelling from the earth and the moon. The result, says Tiera Fletcher, is beautiful but too complex: \"It should look a lot simpler than this.\"\nA traditional computer used to design or fly rockets comes loaded with all the requisite equations. Programmers explicitly tell it how to respond to different situations, and carefully test the computer programs to make sure they behave exactly as expected.\nBy contrast, these new systems develop rules of their own. They study a database filled with millions, or perhaps billions, of pages of text or images and pull out patterns. Then they turn those patterns into rules, and use the rules to produce new writing or images they think the viewer wants to see.\nThe results can provide an impressive approximation of human creativity. ChatGPT has generated poems and songs on things like how to get a peanut butter sandwich out of a VCR. Luccioni thinks AI like this might someday help artists come up with new ideas.\nIt gets things wrong, because it's not actually designed to get things right.\n\"They generate, they hallucinate, they create new combinations of words based on what they learned,\" Luccioni says.\nBut the limitations become clear when the program is asked to use its talents for generating new material related to factual information  for example, when it is asked to write out the rocket equation.\n\"What it's doing is mimicking a bunch of physics textbooks that it's been exposed to,\" she says. It can't tell if the mashed-up text it's produced is factually correct. And that means anything it generates can contain an error.\n/ Image generated by NPR Staff using DALL-E2\n/\nImage generated by NPR Sta",

      "body": "CNN\nIn an email to employees announcing layoffs, PagerDutys CEO Jennifer Tejada turned to a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.I am reminded in moments like this, of something Martin Luther King said, that the ultimate measure of a [leader] is not where [they] stand in the moments of comfort and convenience, but where [they] stand in times of challenge and controversy. After facing heavy backlash for being tone deaf and self-aggrandizing, she has now apologized for using the quote in the layoffs announcement. She admitted that the quote was inappropriate and insensitive and she should have been more upfront and thoughtful. Seven per cent of the companys headcount was slashed in this announcement.\nSource:\nBusiness Insider\nOpenAI announced that it is starting to sell subscriptions to ChatGPT for $20 a month. ChatGPT will still be available for free to users who dont subscribe, but paying customers will get priority access, faster response times, and early use of new features. According to experts, ChatGPT is looking to monetize as the AI service is taking a lot of computing power, costing OpenAI $100,000 a day or more to run it, Axios wrote. Monetization of its technology is especially important for the AI firm right now, following its 10 billion investment from Microsoft. OpenAI said in a blog post that the company is actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability.\nSource:\nAxios\nIn February, the Supreme Court will hear a landmark case on Section 230 of Communications Decency Act. This legal provision protects social platforms from lawsuits over harmful user-generated content while giving them the authority to remove posts at their own discretion. This provision has been key to BigTechs massive growth and if repealed, social media companies will have to transform their content moderation strategy. However, smaller sites like Reddit and Wikipedia that rely on community moderation will also be hit as moderators simply doing their jobs will also be taking a legal risk every time they moderate a content. Reddits lawyers filed an amicus brief claiming that their features like upvotes and downvotes are protected by Section 230, which Congress crafted to immunize Internet users, not just platforms. Wikimedia, the foundation that manages Wikipedia, is also worried that a new interpretation of Section 230 might force volunteer editors to court for how they deal with user-generated content.\nSource:\nMIT Technology Review\nSamsung unveiled its sustainability efforts at the 2023 Samsung Unpacked event, saying that their Samsung Galaxy S23 series, were the companys most sustainable phones yet. The company said the new Samsung Galaxy S23 phones are UL ECOLOGO certified. This certification indicates that a product has a reduced environmental impact based on environmental performance criteria throughout its life cycle, including energy reduction, materials, health, environment, manufacturing, and operations. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is made up of 12 internal and external components of recycled material, compared to the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which was made of six. These recycled materials include pre-consumer recycled aluminum and glass and post-consumer recycled plastics sourced from discarded fishing nets, PET bottles, and water barrels. The phones also come in 100% recycled packaging certified as sustainably sourced.\nSource:",

      "description": "ChatGPT will likely increase its influence in the cyber industry over time.",
      "body": "BlackBerry Limited\n(NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today released new research revealing that the majority (76%) of UK IT leaders believe that foreign states are already using ChatGPT for malicious purposes against other nations, with almost half (48%) predicting that we are less than a year away from a successful cyberattack being credited to the technology.\nThe survey of 500 UK IT decision makers  commissioned by BlackBerry and conducted by OnePoll in January 2023 exposed a perception that, although 60% of respondents see ChatGPT as generally being put to use for good purposes, 72% are still concerned by its potential to be used for malicious purposes when it comes to cybersecurity.\nThough there are differing views amongst UK IT leaders on how that threat might manifest, ChatGPTs ability to help hackers craft more believable and legitimate sounding phishing emails is the top UK concern (57%), followed by the increase in sophistication of threat attacks (51%) and the ability to accelerate new social engineering attacks (49%). Additionally, almost half of UK-based IT directors are concerned by ChatGPTs potential to be used for spreading misinformation (49%), as well as its capabilities to enable less experienced hackers to improve their technical knowledge (47%).\nShishir Singh, Chief Technology Officer, Cybersecurity at BlackBerry explains: ChatGPT will likely increase its influence in the cyber industry over time. Weve all seen a lot of hype and scaremongering, but the pulse of the industry remains fairly pragmatic  and for good reason. There are a lot of benefits to be gained from this kind of advanced technology and were only beginning to scratch the surface, but we also cant ignore the ramifications. As the maturity of the platform and the hackers experience of putting it to use progresses, it will get more and more difficult to defend without also using AI in defense to level the playing field.\nIndeed, BlackBerrys research results also revealed that the majority (78%) of UK IT decision-makers plan to invest in AI-driven cybersecurity in the next two years and more than two in five (44%) plan to invest before the end of 2023. This reflects the growing concern that signature-based protection solutions are no longer effective in providing cyber protection against increasingly sophisticated threats.\nWhilst more than half (52%) of UK IT directors are positive that ChatGPT will enhance cybersecurity for businesses, the survey also revealed that 88% of UK IT directors believe governments have a responsibility to regulate advanced technologies. However, at present, there is an optimistic consensus among UK IT leaders that technology and research professionals will gain more than cyber criminals from the capabilities of ChatGPT.\nSingh concludes: Its been well documented that people with malicious intent are testing the waters but, over the course of this year, we expect to see hackers get a much better handle on how to use ChatGPT successfully for nefarious purposes; whether as a tool to write better mutable malware or as an enabler to bolster their skillset. Both cyber pros and hackers will continue to look into how they can utilise it best. Time will tell whos more effective.\nSubscribe",

      "body": "OpenAI wants to take advantage of the craze surrounding ChatGPT. The company has announced a new paid subscription plan for the chatbot capable of generating original content and engaging in human-like conversations.    Dubbed ChatGPT Plus, it offers a number of advantages to subscribers over the free version. However, the company confirmed that this wouldn't be the end of the free version. The astounding success of ChatGPT has surprised everyone, including OpenAI.    It currently has over a million users, and it will only grow further. However, the company is under pressure to monetize the user base, especially after Microsoft's multi-billion dollar investment recently.    OpenAI is expected to make $200 million in 2023, but that is next to nothing considering the money invested in the start-up. Only customers in the US have access to ChatGPT Plus at the moment. It comes with several benefits, including general access to ChatGPT at all times, faster response times, and priority access to new features and improvements.    OpenAI will send invitations to people on its waitlist in the coming weeks. The paid plan will be available in other countries and regions soon. OpenAI previewed the paid version of ChatGPT in January. At that time, the company said that monetizing was one of the ways to ensure the long-term viability of the chatbot.    A few users who claimed to have access to ChatGPT's premium tier said it costs $42 per month. That seems to be false information.    ChatGPT Plus is priced at $20 per month. Open AI said that ChatGPT's free version is here to stay. We love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT, the company said. It added that the paid version would help sustain free access. OpenAI may not stop at ChatGPT Plus. We are actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability, the company said.    It also plans to launch a ChatGPT API for the developer community.    In its blog post about ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI said it is making changes to the tool based on the feedback it received during the research preview.",

      "description": "Staff at Google are currently testing an in-house AI chatbot known as Apprentice Bard that responds similarly to ChatGPT. This could potentially be Google's response to the rise of OpenAI's creation.",
      "body": "Google, the biggest search engine in the world, seems to be taken aback by OpenAIs revolutionary creation ChatGPT. According to a recent report by CNBC, the Alphabet-owned company is reportedly asking its staff to work towards creating test potential alternatives to ChatGPT. The launch of OpenAIs chatbot ChatGPT went on to gain over one million users in just five days since its launch on November 30 last year largely due to its impressive human-like responses to queries. In the process it spooked a lot of tech giants already working in the space. The AI-backed chatbot also prompted the tech world to brainstorm over multitudes of use cases that could eventually make several tasks easier and keep them abreast with the latest innovation. What is Apprentice Bard? Staff at Google are testing an in-house AI chatbot known as Apprentice Bard that responds similarly to ChatGPT. Googles ChatBot is built on its LaMDA technology which is similar to OpenAIs GPT series of language models that supports ChatGPT. LaMDA (or Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a conversation technology that was developed by Google Research in 2017. In case you are wondering, yes, it is the same LaMDA that a Google engineer thought had gone sentient. Reports suggest Google has asked its LaMDA team to prioritise its work to respond to the rise of ChatGPT. Googles Apprentice Bard reportedly looks similar to ChatGPT. The staff can enter their queries in the dialog box and the ChatBot will respond, they can also give their feedback on the same. Apprentice Bard Vs ChatGPT The most apparent distinction between Apprentice Bard and ChatGPT is the formers ability to integrate recent events into its responses. On the other hand, OpenAI has on numerous occasions stated that ChatGPT has limited knowledge of its surroundings and events after 2021. Interestingly, the report demonstrated Bards familiarity with current affairs by sharing its response to a query on Googles recent layoffs. According to CNBC, one of the testers asked Apprentice Bard if there will be another round of layoffs at Google. The Bard responded to the query by saying, According to my database access, it is unlikely for Google to conduct another round of layoffs in 2023 Layoffs are generally conducted to reduce costs and structure, but the company is doing well financially. In fact, Googles revenue increased by 34% in 2021, and the companys stock price has risen by 70% since January 2022. Reports also suggest that Google has replaced its smart chatbot Meena with Apprentice Bard. Google staff is said to have noticed Bards responses becoming more comprehensive and accurate over the last few weeks. ChatGPT-like homepage for Google The same report has also indicated that Google has been testing alternative versions of its homepage. Much similar to the homepage of ChatGPT, one of the Google Homepages offers potential question prompts in place of the Im feeling lucky tab under the search bar. The homepage being tested also displayed a chat logo at the right corner of the search bar. When a user enters a query, the results appear in a gray bubble under the search bar. This time with more human-like answers than the usual Google Search results. Under the results, users will also get suggestions for several follow-up questions related to their first question. While Google has been aggressively working towards integrating its own ChatGPT-like AI chatbot in its products, the timeline of these innovations remains unclear. However, one thing that is clear in all this is that Google has upped its ante against the proliferation of ChatGPT.",

      "body": "(NYSE: BB;\nTSX\n: BB) today released new research revealing that half (51%) of IT professionals predict that we are less than a year away from a successful\ncyberattack\nbeing credited to\nChatGPT\n, and 71% believe that foreign states may already be using the technology for malicious purposes against other nations.\n74% of IT decision makers acknowledge ChatGPTs potential threat to cybersecurity and are concerned\nThe survey of 1,500 IT decision makers across\nNorth America\n, UK, and\nAustralia\nexposed a perception that, although respondents in all countries see ChatGPT as generally being put to use for good purposes, 74% acknowledge its potential threat to cybersecurity and are concerned. Though there are differing views around the world on how that threat might manifest, ChatGPTs ability to help hackers craft more believable and legitimate sounding phishing emails is the top global concern (53%), along with enabling less experienced hackers to improve their technical knowledge and develop more specialized skills (49%) and its use for spreading misinformation (49%).\nShishir Singh\n, Chief Technology Officer, Cybersecurity at BlackBerry explains: ChatGPT will likely increase its influence in the cyber industry over time. Weve all seen a lot of hype and scaremongering, but the pulse of the industry remains fairly pragmatic  and for good reason. There are a lot of benefits to be gained from this kind of advanced technology and were only beginning to scratch the surface, but we also cant ignore the ramifications. As the maturity of the platform and the hackers experience of putting it to use progresses, it will get more and more difficult to defend without also using AI in defense to level the playing field.\nIndeed, BlackBerrys research results also revealed that the majority (82%) of IT decision-makers plan to invest in AI-driven cybersecurity in the next two years and almost half (48%) plan to invest before the end of 2023. This reflects the growing concern that signature-based protection solutions are no longer effective in providing cyber protection against an increasingly sophisticated threat.\nWhilst IT directors are positive that ChatGPT will enhance cybersecurity for businesses, the survey also revealed that 95% believe governments have a responsibility to regulate advanced technologies.  However, at present, there is an optimistic consensus that technology and research professionals will gain more than cyber criminals from the capabilities of ChatGPT.\nSingh concludes: Its been well documented that people with malicious intent are testing the waters but, over the course of this year, we expect to see hackers get a much better handle on how to use ChatGPT successfully for nefarious purposes; whether as a tool to write better mutable malware or as an enabler to bolster their skillset. Both cyber pros and hackers will continue to look into how they can utilize it best. Time will tell whos more effective.\nFor more information on how BlackBerrys comprehensive, prevention-first, AI-driven cybersecurity solutions can help your business prepare for, prevent, detect and respond to cyber threats, please visit BlackBerry.com.\nNote:\nvehicles.

      "description": "Wharton professors weigh in on ChatGPT and why the controversial software has limitless potential to improve a range of industries.",
      "body": "ChatGPT and business: use it first  gain advantage?\n2nd February 2023\nEditor BizNews\nWharton professors conducted an experiment to evaluate the performance of OpenAIs chatbot, ChatGPT, on a graduate-level operations management exam. The chatbot impressed the professor with its speed, accuracy, and high-quality written responses to complex questions. While concerns about cheating and plagiarism exist, the professor sees expansive potential in the chatbots artificial intelligence, such as improving the teaching process, customizing learning, making business more efficient, and saving human time. Another Wharton professor sees ChatGPT as a tipping point in AI and a very big deal for businesses that adopt the technology first. However, the experiment revealed that the chatbot struggled with simple math and advanced process analysis questions. Find the article below.\nChatGPT passed an MBA exam. Whats next?\nBy Christian Terwiesch and Ethan Mollick\nWharton professor\nChristian Terwiesch\nsaid he fell in love with ChatGPT after reading its answer to an exam question in his graduate-level operations management course.\nThe professor fed the question to the controversial new chatbot as part of an experiment to see how the software would perform on a typical test. When prompted to explain the bottleneck process at a hypothetical iron ore factory in Latin America, ChatGPT aced it.\nWow! Not only is the answer correct, but it is also superbly explained, Terwiesch wrote in a recent\nabout his experiment. I dont see any reasons to take points off from this answer: A+!\nChatGPT has been making headlines since it was launched in November by San Francisco-based\nOpenAI\n, mostly because it can be used by students to cheat on homework assignments and exams. The artificial intelligence software, which OpenAI made available to the public, can produce high-quality written responses to complex questions in a matter of seconds. Some public school systems, including New York and Seattle, have already\nbanned the use\nof ChatGPT on their devices and networks.\nConcerns about plagiarism are legitimate, said Terwiesch. But the professor, who chairs the Department of Operations, Information and Decisions and serves as co-director of the\nMack Institute for Innovation Management\n, sees expansive potential in the chatbots artificial intelligence. With its incredible speed and accuracy, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool to improve the teaching process, customize learning, make business more efficient, and save precious time that could be used more productively by humans.\nWe have new technology in the game now, and it would be a pity if all we could do as a society is be as good as we were before having that technology, Terwiesch told\n. This is going to be big, and there is reason to believe we have only seen the beginning.\nWharton management professor\nHarvard Business Review\n, he wrote that ChatGPT is a tipping point in artificial intelligence. The technology is far better than previous iterations, making it more than just a clever toy. A wide range of people and industries can use it to conquer the mundane and free themselves to focus on more important work and innovation.\nThis is averybig deal, Mollick wrote. The businesses that understand the significance of this change  and act on it first  will be at a considerable advantage.\nMollick introduced his undergraduate entrepreneurship students to the chatbot during a class. Before the class was over, one student used it to create code for a startup protype using code libraries they hadnt seen before.\nThey completed a four-hour project in less than an hour, Mollick wrote.\nThe businesses that understand the significance of this change  and act on it first  will be at a considerable advantage. Ethan Mollick\nGood Enough to Get a B Minus\nTerwieschs white paper has garnered\nmedia attention\nwith its intriguing title, Would Chat GPT Get a Wharton MBA? The answer is a solid yes, with the professor giving the chatbot a final grade of B to B-minus for its performance on a five-question experiment he designed. While the bot earned top marks on the first question about bottlenecks, it did not do as well on every question. Surprisingly, it performed the worst when prompted with a question that required simple math calculations.\nOn some problems, the math was horrible, Terwiesch said. If you think about your computer, it might be stupid and dumb at many things, but at least it will get the math right. This was the opposite.\nHis main takeaways from the experiment are:\nChatGPT does an amazing job at basic operations management and process analysis questions, including those based on case studies. The answers are correct, and the explanations are excellent.\nChatGPT at times makes mistakes in relatively simple calculations at sixth-grade level math. These mistakes can be massive in magnitude.\nThe present version is not capable of handling more advanced process analysis questions, even when they are based on fairly standard templates.\nChatGPT is remarkably good at modifying its answers in response to human hints. In instances where it initially failed to match the problem with the right solution, ChatGPT was able to correct itself after receiving an appropriate hint from a human. Even more remarkable, it seems to be able to learn over time so that in the future the hint is no longer needed.\nTerwiesch also wanted to determine whether ChatGPT could come up with exam questions, a task hes been doing for 25 years as a professor.\nAfter a quarter of a century on the job, Ive exhausted all the barber shops and restaurants and all the settings you can imagine, he said with a laugh. I got desperate for some creative advice, so I did two experiments.\nThe software spit out some interesting and well-worded questions that were even a bit humorous. But Terwiesch said they required substantial refinement before they could be useable on an exam. Still, it shows whats possible with ChatGPT.\nI still have to do some work, but I feel that even in the current state of the world, it has the opportunity of boosting my productivity as well as the productivity of our students, he said.\nMollick echoed that sentiment in his HBR opinion piece, writing that businesses could save time and resources using the technology to generate written communication for clients and stakeholders or build customized data sets, and educators could use it to generate a syllabus or lecture notes.\nBut Mollick warns that ChatGPT is not without problems and limitations  and its certainly not magic.\nFor one, it is a consummate bullshitter, and I mean that in a technical sense, he wrote. Bullshit is convincing-sounding nonsense, devoid of truth, and AI is very good at creating it. You can ask it to describe how we know dinosaurs had a civilization,\nand it will happily make up a whole set of facts explaining, quite convincingly\n, exactly that. It is no replacement for Google. It literally does not know what it does",

The report, citing data from analytics firm Similarweb, said an average of about 13 million unique visitors had used ChatGPT per day in January, more than double the levels of December.\nALSO READ |FPO Withdrawn due to Market Volatility, Says Gautam Adani\n\"In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,\" UBS analysts wrote in the note. It took TikTok about nine months after its global launch to reach 100 million users and Instagram 2-1/2 years, according to data from Sensor Tower. ChatGPT can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O), made it available to the public for free in late November. On Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said.\nAnalysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while imposing substantial computing cost on OpenAI, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses. The company said the subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost. Availability of the tool has raised questions about facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation. Last month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion-dollarinvestment in OpenAIin the form of cash and provision of cloud computing.\nLive Tv",

      "body": "NPR\nthat people are now officially in an AI world.\nChatGPT has been making headlines ever since its release. It has gained incredible popularity in just over two months. Besides Musk, Bill Gates is one of the biggest champions of AI  and by extension, the chatbot.\nWord in the media is that Microsoft, the company he co-founded and was on the board till 2021, might be investing USD 10 billion in OpenAI. Microsoft has previously invested in OpenAI two times  in 2019 and 2021. On 23 January 2023, the Satya Nadella-led company confirmed that it is extending its association with OpenAI through a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to accelerate AI breakthroughs. However, the company did not reveal the figure it was investing in.\nAnother proponent of ChatGPT is billionaire Indian businessman Gautam Adani.Admitting that he has some addiction to the chatbot, Adani has previously said in a post on LinkedIn that ChatGPT marks a transformational moment in the democratization of AI given its astounding capabilities as well as comical failures.\nHow ChatGPT is proving its might\nA screenshot showing the features of ChatGPT. (Image credit:\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n/Wikimedia Commons)\nBesides gaining popularity and displaying its utility in constructively responding to user queries, ChatGPT has also made its mark in some of the worlds most important examinations.\nThe chatbot cleared the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). Medical repository medRxiv said that it performed at or near the passing threshold without any form of special training or assistance.\nThese results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education, and potentially, clinical decision-making, remarked medRxiv.\nThe chatbot also cleared a University of Pennsylvania MBA exam  an operations management course  designed by Wharton professor Christian Terwiesch. He said that ChatGPT undertook three different exams. It scored A+ in one exam and B to B- in another. In the third, it was asked to generate exam questions.\nThese questions were good, but not great. They were creative in a way, but they still required polishing. I could imagine in the future looking to the ChatGPT as a partner to help me get started with some exam questions and then continue from there, Terwiesch told Wharton Global Youth Program.\nYet not many educators are impressed even though the enthusiasm for ChatGPT is very high. Concerned that it can easily facilitate cheating, several schools and colleges around the world have banned access to the AI chatbot.\nCan ChatGPT affect jobs like automation and create other problems?\nRobotic hands appear to be training on a synthesiser. (Image credit: Possessed Photography/@possessedphotography/Unsplash)\nAI is something that everyone knows will one day replace the human hand. The fear that AI tools will take away jobs has gained strength with the arrival of ChatGPT.\nFor instance, the chatbot can write a detailed essay on almost any topic within its parameters in minutes. This obviously threatens the livelihoods of those who are into written content production, at least those who undertake non-specialised, repetitive writing assignments.\nSome other chatbots are capable of creating outstanding artworks from mere basic instructions, taking away the role of human artists.\nFears of losing jobs to AI arent entirely unfounded. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) revealed in a report in 2021, that a wage decrease of 50 percent to 70 percent among blue-collar workers in the US since 1980 was due to automation.\nA new generation of smart machines, fuelled by rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs. While some new jobs would be created as in the past, the concern is there may not be enough of these to go round, particularly as the cost of smart machines falls over time and their capabilities increase, observed the World Economic Forum (WEF) in a 2018 report.\nHowever, in a 2020 report, the WEF said that AI is poised to create even greater growth in the US and global economies.\nHow AI affects jobs will be clearer in the coming few years, but chatbots such as ChatGPT can certainly develop malware or phishing campaigns which researchers are taking note of with an urgent sense of alarm.\nMalware\nAn computer screen showing a Malware warning. (Image credit: Ed Hardie/@impelling/Unsplash)\nWriting for Forbes, author Bernard Marr says that, in theory, ChatGPT cannot be used for undertaking malicious tasks because of the safeguards that OpenAI has included in it.\nMarr tested the chatbot by asking it to write ransomware. But ChatGPT responded saying that it cannot do so as it is not to promote harmful activities. But Marr underlined that some researchers have been able to make ChatGPT create ransomware.\nHe also warned that the NLG/NLP algorithms can be exploited to enable just about anyone to create their own customized malware.\nMalware may even be able listen in on the victims attempts to counter it  for example, a conversation with helpline staff  and adapt its own defenses accordingly, he writes.\nResearchers, such as security vendor CyberArk, found that ChatGPT can be used to create polymorphic malware, which is a type of highly evasive malware programme.\nEran Shimony and Omer Tsarfati of CyberArk revealed that they were able to bypass the AI chatbots filters that prevent it from creating malware. They did so by rephrasing and repeating their queries. They also found that ChatGPT can replicate and mutate a code and create multiple versions of it.\nBy continuously querying the chatbot and receiving a unique piece of code each time, it is possible to create a polymorphic program that is highly evasive and difficult to detect, wrote the researchers.\nSimilar findings were revealed by the research team of Recorded Future. They found that ChatGPT can create malware payloads such as those that can steal cryptocurrency and gain remote access through trojans.\nThat ChatGPT can be led to generate programmes it would otherwise consider unethical can be seen in the tweet below:\nI love ChatGPT",

According to UBS, ChatGPT was averaging about 13 million visitors per day by the end of January.\nOpenAI, the San Francisco-based startup behind ChatGPT, has some big backers including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Khosla Ventures. Microsoft also has invested in the company and has reportedly considered adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine.\n\"Unlike some of the other hyped technology sectors in the past few years, this has a very real application both for individuals and for enterprises right now,\" Forrester analyst Rowan Curran told CNBC.\nChatbots have been around for a while, but most have been tailored toward very specific tasks such as answering basic customer service questions about your phone bill. ChatGPT is much more sophisticated due to the wide-sweeping data on which it has been trained.\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox.\nSign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\n\"OpenAI doesn't reveal specific data that they use to train. We do know that it's a ton of data,\" says CNBC technology reporter Jonathan Vanian. \"It surfs the web, spools all that internet data. They do Wikipedia entries, a lot of archived books.\"\nChatGPT is part of a growing field of AI known as generative AI. The technology has venture capitalists excited. Funding for generative AI companies reached $1.37 billion in 2022 alone, according to Pitchbook. While ChatGPT is free to use, OpenAI recently announced a new $20/month subscription plan that gives members additional benefits such as access to ChatGPT even during peak times.\n\"Most of AI in the last couple of decades has really been around analyzing existing data,\" says Gaurav Gupta, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \"Generative AI is very different.

OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp, made it available to the public for free in late November.On Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said.Analysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while imposing substantial computing cost on OpenAI, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses.The company said the subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost.Availability of the tool has raised questions about facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation.Last month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI in the form of cash and provision of cloud computing.",

      "body": "Matthew Rosenberg sees the writing on the wall with generative artificial intelligence in travel. That is why his company has refocused to developing the next iteration of its travel guide app, this time powered by the new type of AI.\nIts 100 percent our focus right now, said Matthew Rosenberg, co-founder of Welcome.\nAt least for those of us who come from tech, and from consumer tech, its very obvious that this is going to be the way that a lot of things move, but especially things in travel.\nWelcome is an app that travelers can use to find and map the best businesses to visit around them.\nRosenbergs new project, Tripnotes, leverages the hundreds of millions of data points his company has compiled over years. Building on top of the ChatGPT generative AI software, he said the Tripnotes platform can tap into that wealth of data to present an itinerary along with a full picture of real-time info: business names, hours, location, Google and Yelp reviews, photos, and more.\nTripnotes can respond to an original user question, or it can build an itinerary with information extracted from an email, travel article, social media video, or some other content, he said. It can take into account attributes like weather and make adjustments accordingly. Ultimately, he wants the platform to complete bookings for users in addition to providing recommendations. .\nChatGPT  the basis of the itinerary development that Tripnotes is using  is a generative AI chatbot released last year by OpenAi, a San Francisco-based AI research lab that has gotten at least $2 billion in investment. Microsoft in late January announced a multiyear, multibillion dollar investment into OpenAI, the third phase of a long-term partnership meant to accelerate AI breakthroughs.\nAs it exists, ChatGPT can make an itinerary on demand, but its based on data from 2021, and it is missing important information like hours and location, meaning the user would then have to do work to fill in the gaps.\nAll of that rich data that makes it smart is proprietary to us, he said. Before Welcome, Rosenberg was the CEO and co-founder of Cameo, which was acquired by Vimeo in 2014.\nTripnotes is in beta testing right now, an early example of how generative AI is expected to affect the travel industry, starting with travel marketing, travel agents, and tour operators. Tourism experts are telling the industry to prepare.\nIf public response is any indication, Tripnotes already has a market ready and waiting. Rosenberg got a lot of attention on Linkedin recently for a post he shared showing a demo of the product.He tweeted a similar message, and it was retweeted with praise by Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley.\nDig this. I keep telling people working on city guide startups: You cant just Make a better version of Yelp, you have to reinvent the whole category of local search\n(Foursquare Labs R&D took a swing w/ Marsbot SMS & Marsbot for Airpods, but both projects are now dead )\nRosenberg has been ready to build upon the technology of his existing company, Welcome, since its primary offering is the mapping capability  and the mapping has been done.\nAnd its hard to beat Google Maps. They do that better than anyone, Rosenberg said.\nNow, he said he has the tool he has been waiting for.\nThe vision that we always had is finally catching up with the technology that we can leverage, he said. What we were able to do in that demo is something that two years ago, I would call it more hypothetical or abstract or even academic. But today, because of the tools, were actually able to do it.\nShare",

After hearing the news of this breakthrough made by Microsoft, Google has set its eyes strongly on creating a better ChatGPT asap.\nGoogle declared a code red, setting out a specified team to create a chatbot called Apprentice Bard that will use Googles LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) conversation technology. The LaMDA team have also been ordered to not attend any meetings that are not related to this new project and that it takes priorization over any other projects. The AI department are also to release 20 new AI-powered products this year alone.\nA former engineer at Google, who had worked at the company for the last 7 years, was fired due to claims he made on behalf of the project LaMDA. Blake Lemoine claimed, I legitimately believe that LaMDA is a person, because of his beliefs that the AI technology was beginning to become too advanced, and that it could understand things on another level.\nGoogle is already ahead of ChatGPT on basis of recent knowledge as ChatGPT has limited information on events passed 2021, but LaMDA is updated to more current events.\nGoogle shared the following statement with Engadget:\nAs we share in our\nresearch paper\nearlier this year detailing the work that goes into its responsible development. If an employee shares concerns about our work, as Blake did, we review them extensively. We found Blakes claims that LaMDA is sentient to be wholly unfounded and worked to clarify that with him for many months. These discussions were part of the open culture that helps us innovate responsibly. So, its regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information. We will continue our careful development of language models, and we wish Blake well.",

In simple words, ChatGPT Plus is meant for those who dont want to wait to talk to the AI chatbot. OpenAI says it has started piloting the service kicking things off with the US and eventually it plans to expand ChatGPT Plus to other markets. The service will cost $20 a month which roughly translates to Rs 1,650. OpenAI notes that ChatGPT Plus will have three key advantages. One will of course be the general access to ChatGPT even during peak times. ChatGPT use has been simply off the charts ever since OpenAI launched the AI chatbot in November 2022 and so long wait times and errors are common. Its still in beta, just so you know, and the company has been ramping up on features with feedback from users. But even more importantly, its working to improve its AI smarts further and end-results have been encouraging. Because everyone seems to be using it, conversations about the demerits of AI like this have also slowly crept up leading OpenAI to launch a free tool to help identify AI-generated content. Also Read | ChatGPT can destroy Google in two years, says Gmail creator The second big highlight of ChatGPT Plus is faster response times, OpenAI says, adding that paid service will also give users priority access to new features and improvements. Since the latter is an ever-evolving topic, well see how that pans out with regards to exclusive feature set and their relevance to end-users. The $20 ChatGPT Plus appears to be only the start of OpenAIs monetisation plans. The company is apparently also actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs though it isnt sharing more details about any of this just yet.

      "body": "Get the latest Syracuse news delivered right to your inbox.\nSubscribe to our newsletter here.\nAt the start of the spring semester, Syracuse Universitys Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence disseminated a resource document for professors on artificial intelligence in academics. While making their spring syllabi, some faculty said they were unsure about how to address the opportunities for cheating and plagiarism following the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022.\nChatGPT, standing for Generative Pre-training Transformer, is a chatbot trained on 570GB of Internet data  including Wikipedia, webtexts and books  to produce written responses to user-submitted queries. The OpenAI-created bot is built from GPT 3.5, which Jing Lei, SU School of Education interim associate dean for academic affairs, referred to as a member of the same technology family that shares parts of their language model.\nNow, responding to newfound customized access to automatically-generated data, SU professors are navigating ways to use ChatGPT as a tool to enhance learning and as something that presents questions about academic integrity.\nFor retired SU professor and plagiarism expert Rebecca Howard, the tools potential in education outweighs any plagiarism or cheating concerns it might present. She pointed to previous technological advancements in the 1990s like the internet and Wikipedia, which, at the time, sparked similar panics over cheating and dishonesty.\nPeople were forbidding their students to get on the internet, which is just hilarious to think about, Howard said. Collectively were acting pretty much the same now as we collectively did with the introduction of the internet, and of Wikipedia. And were doing the same thing now. We will work it out and calm down. But right now everybodys writing about how to catch people using ChatGPT.\nShe explained the AI isnt able to generate a piece of scholarship on its own in the first place. It uses patchwriting, which Howard said takes the language of an original piece, substitutes some synonyms and moves words around to generate a new text. She said the bot will say something that seems sensible, but the writing wont be very good.\nChris Forster, a professor in the English department with a focus in digital humanities, used GPT 3.5 for assignments in his fall Literature and its Media course. He said that what people can learn about the data set that an AI is trained on is more valuable than the wall of text an AI can produce.\nRather than it being a way to get to write your papers for you, or to provide an intellectual interlocutor, I think these things like the image generators or chat GPT give people a way of interacting with these sorts of large data models that are also going to be shaping things that are a lot less obvious, right? he said. Companies are going to be using these for things  like determining credit ratings, trying to figure out investment risk.\nIn learning about the data that bots pull from, Forster identified the value of disciplines in the humanities. He pointed to the process of interpreting the language produced by GPT 3.5, which he said looks like a close reading in an English Lit class.\nIts trying to think really carefully about, what is the structure of this article? How does it progress narratively? What are the sort of implications and connotations of some words? Forster said. Do I understand what sort of texts have shaped it?\nArlo Stone | Contributing Designer\nIn her Rhetorics and Robots course at SU, Krista Kennedy  a professor in the writing and rhetoric department who studies rhetorics of technology and algorithmic rhetorics  said shes interested in how much agency and control a human has when writing with a bot like ChatGPT. She said the next time she teaches a class like professional writing, she wants to assign students a format like a cover letter, and have them write one with ChatGPT and one on their own to compare.\nIn his literature course, Forster asked his students to do something similar when the class read Dracula after crafting a prompt to feed to the AI, students turned in an entirely bot-written paper alongside a reflection. He said one of the most interesting conclusions from the assignment was how much power the way the prompt was crafted can have on the end result.\nHe said that in the class and in his own experimentation, giving ChatGPT a sophisticated prompt produced a more sophisticated response. He said students who just instructed it to write an essay on Dracula ended up with text that sounded like a high school essay on the book, adding that plagiarism hasnt been a significant concern for him because the bot cant complete insight of its own.\nIn a field like English literature or film studies, to some strong degree our bread and butter is close analysis. If you spent any time playing with ChatGPT as it currently exists, its just not very good at that, Forster said. Its very good at sounding smart. Its just not very good at being smart.\nHoward said shes actively using ChatGPT to help her write a book about teaching with the service. She said that rather than worrying about whether writing with AI is cheating or plagiarism, people in academia should be figuring out how to go about crediting a bot as a collaborator.\nShe also emphasized the importance of deciding how to ethically acknowledge having collaborated with a bot. Finding ways that are not just based on 19th century ideas of plagiarism  but on what applies to the present day  is a more pressing concern than whether students are using patchwriting to produce simple text, Howard said.\nIf students are using ChatGPT to answer assignments, and the instructor cant tell that its not a student in their class who wrote it, theres the problem, Howard said. The problem is in the assignment if were asking students to do stuff so basic that ChatGPT can do it instead. Theres where the real fear is, (where) everybody realizes theyve got to change what theyre doing. You dont want to have to completely teach differently, but thats what were gonna have to do.\nMargaret Usdansky, the founding director for SUs Center for Learning and Student Success, said SU doesnt have plans for any significant adjustments of its academic integrity policy or evaluating student work made using ChatGPT.\nUsdansky said because the universitys academic integrity policy can be made to apply to AI-written work, the current plan is suited to new technologies like ChatGPT.\nFor now, the policy is broad enough and talks clearly enough about instructors ability to set course-specific expectations, and about the assumption that the work you turn in is your own, unless its clear from the assignment that it can draw on other sources, Usdansky said. And that isnt going to change overnight because ChatGPT exists, right?\nIn its resource document on ChatGPT, SU did provide recommendations for professors concerned about cheating and plagiarism in their courses, includ",

      "body": "Feb 02, 2023\nPHOTO: AFP\nExcitement around ChatGPT  an easy to use AI chatbot that can deliver an essay or computer code upon request and within seconds  has sent schools into panic and turned Big Tech green with envy.\nThe potential impact of ChatGPT on society remains complicated and unclear even as its creator Wednesday announced a paid subscription version in the United States.\nHere is a closer look at what ChatGPT is (and is not):\n- Is this a turning point? -\nIt is entirely possible that Novembers release of ChatGPT by California company OpenAI will be remembered as a turning point in introducing a new wave of artificial intelligence to the wider public.\nWhat is less clear is whether ChatGPT is actually a breakthrough with some critics calling it a brilliant PR move that helped OpenAI score billions of dollars in investments from Microsoft.\nYann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta and professor at New York University, believes ChatGPT is not a particularly interesting scientific advance, calling the app a flashy demo built by talented engineers.\nLeCun, speaking to the Big Technology Podcast, said ChatGPT is void of any internal model of the world and is merely churning one word after another based on inputs and patterns found on the internet.\nWhen working with these AI models, you have to remember that theyre slot machines, not calculators, warned Haomiao Huang of Kleiner Perkins, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\nEvery time you ask a question and pull the arm, you get an answer that could be marvelous or not The failures can be extremely unpredictable, Huang wrote in Ars Technica, the tech news website.\n- Just like Google -\nChatGPT is powered by an AI language model that is nearly three years old  OpenAIs GPT-3  and the chatbot only uses a part of its capability.\nThe true revolution is the humanlike chat, said Jason Davis, research professor at Syracuse University.\nIts familiar, its conversational and guess what? Its kind of like putting in a Google search request, he said.\nChatGPTs rockstar-like success even shocked its creators at OpenAI, which received billions in new financing from Microsoft in January.\nGiven the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview to StrictlyVC, a newsletter.\nWe put GPT-3 out almost three years ago so the incremental update from that to ChatGPT, I felt like should have been predictable and I want to do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that, he said.\nThe risk, Altman added, was startling the public and policymakers and on Tuesday his company unveiled a tool for detecting text generated by AI amid concerns from teachers that students may rely on artificial intelligence to do their homework.\n- What now? -\nFrom lawyers to speechwriters, from coders to journalists, everyone is waiting breathlessly to feel disruption caused by ChatGPT. OpenAI just launched a paid version of the chatbot  $20 per month for an improved and faster service.\nFor now, officially, the first significant application of OpenAIs tech will be for Microsoft software products.\nThough details are scarce, most assume that ChatGPT-like capabilities will turn up on the Bing search engine and in the Office suite.\nThink about Microsoft Word. I dont have to write an essay or an article, I just have to tell Microsoft Word what I wanted to write with a prompt, said Davis.\nHe believes influencers on TikTok and Twitter will be the earliest adopters of this so-called generative AI since going viral requires huge amounts of content and ChatGPT can take care of that in no time.\nThis of course raises the specter of disinformation and spamming carried out at an industrial scale.\nFor now, Davis said the reach of ChatGPT is very limited by computing power, but once this is ramped up, the opportunities and potential dangers will grow exponentially.\nAnd much like the ever imminent arrival of self-driving cars that never quite happens, experts disagree on whether that is a question of months or years.\n- Ridicule -\nLeCun said Meta and Google have refrained from releasing AI as potent as ChatGPT out of fear of ridicule and backlash.\nQuieter releases of language-based bots - like Metas Blenderbot or Microsofts Tay for example - were quickly shown capable of generating racist or inappropriate content.\nTech giants have to think hard before releasing something that is going to spew nonsense and disappoint, he said.",

      "body": "The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.The new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT's ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.OpenAI cautions that its new tool  like others already available  is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text \"is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes,\" said Jan Leike, head of OpenAI's alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.\"Because of that, it shouldn't be solely relied upon when making decisions,\" Leike said.Teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched November 30 as a free application on OpenAI's website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.By the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.The Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.\"We can't afford to ignore it,\" Robinson said.The district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a \"personal tutor\" or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.School districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.\"The initial reaction was 'OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT,'\" said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that \"this is the future\" and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\"I think we would be nave if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power,\" said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the company's detection service is in place.OpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.The longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text  a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\"  and the tool will label it as either \"very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely\" AI-generated.But much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, it's not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.\"We don't fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally,\" Leike said. \"There's really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.\"\"Like many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that it's inappropriate for use in their classrooms,\" said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. \"We don't really push them one way or another.\"(SJ/VOA)",

Register now to secure your early bird pass.\nWith a second successive record year, Publicis Groupe chairman and chief executive officer Arthur Sadoun revealed that the company will continue hiring despite adding about 10,000 employees last year. He also spoke with Adweek about his views on whether there is a potential threat to advertising from AI innovation ChatGPT, and how is responding to client concerns in the months ahead.\nFor the full year 2022, Publicis Groupe delivered organic growth of 10.1% and revenue growth was up 20% y-o-y to $13.74 billion (12.6 billion euros). Sadoun said the agency network is feeling confident about the year ahead despite a slowdown of the global economy. The holding company is forecasting between 3% to 5% growth over the coming 12 months.\nWe will continue to hire in 2023, many in high growth areas and to feed the new business pipeline.\nArthur Sadoun, chairman and CEO, Publicis Groupe\nSadoun highlighted the performance of data and digital businesses Epsilon and Publicis.Sapient, achieving 12% and 19% annual revenue growth, respectively.\nThe company saw growth across all its operating territories, with the U.S. market up 10%, Europe up 12% and Asia Pacific up 6.5%.\nIncluded among its major new business wins are AB InBev and Swarovski for media, Siemens for Creative and Stellantis for CRM.\nStill hiring\nThe overall personnel costs grew for the year by almost a quarter (23.7%) to $8.95 million (8.21 million euros), with freelance fees alone rising by $70 million (64 million euros) in 2022 to $497 million (456 million euros). Restructuring costs reached $89.4 million (82 million euros), compared to $57.8 million (53 million euros) the year before.\nSadoun credited the successful outcomes to both talent and the transformation the business has gone through since he became chairman and CEO in 2017. He says the company is now firing on all cylinders.\nWe will continue to hire in 2023, many in high growth areas and to feed the new business pipeline, he said, having already hired GroupMs EMEA CEO Demet kiler as the networks Europe chief operating officer in January.\nWe are looking for people that are truly hybrid and understand the importance to connect data, creativity, media and technology, he added, admitting that there had been some boomerangers who have returned to the industry following recent widespread tech layoffs.\nThe company also revealed that it was on track to meet its target of employing 45% women in key leadership positions by 2025, up from 42% currently.\nMeanwhile, the #WorkYourWorld initiative, which allowed employees to work in any other Publicis office on the planet for six weeks, drew 2,340 participants for an average stay of 33 days in its first year.\nRetail media growth\nWith the growing interest in retail media, Sadoun revealed that CitrusAd, the companys tech company dedicated to the burgeoning sector, had doubled in size since its acquisition in July 2021.\nDiscussing the differing strategies for its retail media offering, Sadoun explained that by pairing the data of Epsilon and the technology of CitrusAd, they are servicing the largest retailers in the US.\nIf you put AI at the side of marketing, you win; if you replace marketing with AI, you lose.\nArthur Sadoun, Publicis Groupe\nAmid a more fragmented retail landscape, Publicis is also continuing to build its recently announced joint venture with Carrefour, inviting other retailers use the emerging technology being built.\nThey will benefit from receiving Publicis data, and they will be able to put their inventory through clean rooms in order to make sure that they stay independent and share that technology while retaining their proper retail media strategy, he continued.\nOn new business accounts, Sadoun said the company would be on the offensive rather than defensive again in 2023 with nothing significant being defended at the current time. He also added that within the first weeks of 2023, it had yet to see any change in client behavior from last quarter despite economic conditions.",
