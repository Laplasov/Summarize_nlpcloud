Performance is \"significantly worse\" in other languages, Axios reported. The tool also can't distinguish computer code written by humans vs. AI.\nThe company said that it's also working on other tools to help distinguish AI text from words created by humans through means including watermarks.\nBy",

      "description": "Its not hard to see how ChatGPT could be used by students, and why some teachers and school administrators are scrambling to catch cheating.",
      "body": "I recently used ChatGPT for the first time and received this notice. It's safe to say I wasn't the only person interested in learning more about this platform.\nChatGPT image\nChatGPT\nfirst came to my attention through educators who were upset about it on social media. I then heard about the chatbot from teens who were utilizing it to help with their crippling homework load. Most recently I saw a discussion on Facebook with a group of people age 40 and older who were commenting on how ChatGPT is just a trend and a buzzword\nFor those unfamiliar with ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), it is a free online tool that allows you to present text-based queries on a variety of topics. When you get on the website, it provides you with sample questions like, Explain quantum computing in simple terms. ChatGPT also provides a place to type in your particular question. Its not hard to see how the tool could be used by students, and why some teachers and school administrators are scrambling to catch cheating.\nBut is it really cheating? And is that what teens are really using it for?\nI\nwork\nwith teen entrepreneurs, a perfect demographic to turn to and ask some of my top questions about ChatGPT. I posted some questions on our group Slack channel and teen entrepreneur Aliza Katz chimed in right away, I think it's important that everyone recognizes that ChatGPT opens up an entire new world. ChatGPT puts all the information on the internet at your fingertips and essentially takes what used to be a few hour project and turns it into an hour of your time.\n____________________\nAre you concerned about how ChatGPT may drastically change industries? Are you doing anything to prepare?\nMORE FOR YOU\nContract Extension For Myles Turner With The Indiana Pacers Is A Win-Win\nMany of the teens I interviewed shared that it has already changed education, its just a matter of if educators and administrators will embrace the changes.\nSimerus Mahesh, a 17-year-old from Ontario, Canada and co-founder of a mental health wellness AI startup called Talkhappi shared that he is, Always on the lookout, for products that can make life easier so that I can get things done efficiently. Ive learned how to use ChatGPT to get answers to quick questions I have for school courses and receive help with homework. Mahesh isnt concerned about the technology replacing his skill sets, but instead sees it as a tool to help me develop more skills and gain more knowledge so that I can thrive in the sector I choose to go into.\nSarthak Dhawan, 18-year-old co-founder of WorkBee Holidays, agrees that ChatGPT is rewriting the rules of education and sees it as a spark that threatens to upend centuries-old traditional learning methods. Dhawan shared that he is using it to supplement his learning and synthesizing complex concepts, Two weeks ago, in my AP US Government class, we were notified of an upcoming test over 60 US Supreme Court cases. Immediately, I recognized a unique opportunity to utilize ChatGPT. I wrote a program that generates definitions for each Supreme Court case using ChatGPT, then created flashcards in Quizlet with simple-to-understand bullet points. In mere seconds, I had created a remarkable study tool that enabled me to memorize all 60 Supreme Court cases in under 1 hour.\nFor Dhawan, and many other teens I talked with, ChatGPT unlocks ways to increase productivity. They also see the tool as a way to increase their knowledge and gain leverage. Dhawan shared, I have begun to leverage all that Im getting from ChatGPT, ranging from being able to easily explain rotational physics to summarizing published academic journals in quantum computing  the potential is unparalleled.\nDoes ChatGPT have the potential to limit your opportunities and/or potential employment?\nBased on my conversations, all the teens recognize how ChatGPT will replace certain jobs, but that doesnt mean they are fearful.\nKhushi Gupta, a 16 year old teen entrepreneur running the organization With Passion, believes that ChatGPT has completely changed the outlook for the future of some careers. Shes already noticing the impact in her immediate circle of content writers, copywriters, assistants and tutors. Gupta explained, If you can get a perfectly well written essay, article or a mail template to send by through a customer executive, why would someone pay a human to actually do that job when software is a quick and better option? ChatGPT is replacing many jobs in the current workforce by performing many human tasks (in less time and efficient manner) and I believe in the upcoming months (or years). Even knowing that possibility she isnt concerned because shes confident that ChatGPT cant replace her as a podcast host.\nMahesh agrees to a certain extent with Gupta, and has noticed the limitations to ChatGPT. Mahesh presented the perspective that as the complexity and scope increase, ChatGPT is unable to perform tasks that humans have been trained for their entire life such as news reporting on real-time matters. Mahesh said this is because of one key flaw: the fact that ChatGPT cant separate real from fake. He went on to share, ChatGPT is essentially a word organizer that is built on billions of parameters of data and is trained to come up with human-like responses based on its knowledge. It is susceptible to misinformation, something that can impact its results greatly in an age of misinformation.\nHow will ChatGPT change the way people do business?\nSejal Verma, 18-year-old co-founder of Maytik, a tech-integrated makeup startup, has already seen how ChatGPT has changed how she operates her business. The tool has made it possible for her to maintain a small team due to ChatGPT's ability to create content efficiently and accurately. Instead of hiring people, Verma has used it to make rough drafts for pitches, generate captions for social media, and check code for errors. Verma believes, ChatGPT can help businesses improve customer service by providing instant, personalized responses to customer queries and can also assist with sales by providing product recommendations.\nChristine Zhao, 17, is the co-founder of iEmote, an app that facilitates social-emotional learning for people with alexithymia. She sees ChatGPT as one of those technologies that can shatter entire paradigms. Zhao believes one of the tool's greatest strengths is its potential to condense labor-intensive work that would otherwise take humans much longer to complete. For example, one of the components of her app, iEmote, is a content library consisting of literary works and media clips, coupled with guiding questions that would help the user learn from fictitious characters. If her team were to curate the questions manually, they would have had to read or watch every piece of content from the library. ChatGPT provides a shortcut. Below is an example from the preliminary testing of ChatGPTs ability to generate questions:\nZhaos prompt: Can you come up with 5 questions regarding emotion based on",

Who can we turn to in this confusing era where research papers, impressionist paintings, and even TV shows can be rendered by AI? Ashton Kutcher, of course. As part of the actor's digital cover story with Esquire, he answered our burning questions about what he thinks will be the next big thing in tech. It's Generative AI, apparently. Thankfully, Kutcher's take on our burgeoning era of artificial inundation left us with a bit of hope.\n\"We're all concerned that this is going to eliminate jobs,\" Kutcher said. \"Somebody said to me a long time ago that [because of] software, you're either going to have a job telling computers what to do or being told what to do by computers. So we all get to decide in our lives which people we are going to be. AI will replace some jobs, but we will also be able to ask AI, 'What job should I be doing?'\"\nread the cover story\nAshton Kutcher Has Been Through It\nKutcher believes that AI will supplement our lives just as other forms of new-and-improved tech have done in the past. Kutcher has even posed his own questions to AI, once asking, \"What are the seven things I can do to create resilient children?\" Turns out, he found it pretty damn helpful. So maybe knowing how to use AI skillfully will be our saving grace as a society. Kutcher left us with something a bit more promising to chew on: \"I believe we are going to move to an economy of kindness. because intelligence will become commoditized by AI. Thus the most valuable thing you can be as a human being is kind.\"\nOh, sweet Ashton. We sure hope so.",

In the Microsoft Corp.-backed companys evaluations, only 26% of AI-written text was correctly identified. It also flagged 9% of human-written text as being composed by AI.  The tool, called a classifier, will be available as a web app, along with some resources for teachers, the company said in a statement Tuesday. The popularity of ChatGPT has given rise to authorship concerns as students and workers use the bot to create reports and content and pass it off as their own. Its also spurred worries about the ease of auto-generated misinformation campaigns.  While it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text, we believe good classifiers can inform mitigations for false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human: for example, running automated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty, and positioning an AI chatbot as a human, OpenAI said in a blog post.  Since the release of ChatGPT in November, teachers in particular have been struggling to cope. Students quickly realized that the tool could generate term papers and summarize material, albeit while occasionally inserting glaring errors.  Earlier this month, a Princeton University student named Edward Tian released an app called GPTZero that he said he programmed over New Years to detect AI writing. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School developed an AI policy for his classes, which allows students to use ChatGPT as long as they provide a description of what they used the program for and how they used it.  New York Citys public schools have banned using ChatGPT and so has the International Conference on Machine Learning, except in certain cases. The conference ethics statement noted that papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless these produced text is presented as a part of the papers experimental analysis.",

      "body": "Link copied!\nMoney; Shutterstock\nA chatbot powered by artificial intelligence is spurring intense ethical debates across industries from education to media, while striking fear in the hearts of many knowledge workers who worry they could lose their job to a computer.\nBut in certain corners of TikTok, some argue that ChatGPT, the darling chatbot released by the tech firm OpenAI in November, might actually help you\nland\na job.\nThe powerful and free-to-use version of the AI chatbot can produce nuanced sonnets, complex computer code, well-cited research papers and just about everything in between on command.\nAnd, yes, it writes cover letters, too.\nWithin moments of inputting a boilerplate cover letter template  or simply after prompting the AI to create a cover letter from scratch  ChatGPT can produce a fresh one according to your instructions.\nAds by Money.

Click on your state to get started.\nHawaii\nGET STARTED\nIn a viral TikTok video, CEO Jonathan Javier of career consulting company Wonsulting recommends plugging a cover letter template into ChatGPT and letting the chatbot work its magic.\nIt will make you a cover letter so you dont have to waste your time anymore, Javier says in the video, which was uploaded in early January and has already racked up more than 1.2 million views.\nSubmitting a cover letter that you didn't actually write might feel a bit like cheating. But the advice to use ChatGPT for your cover letter is typically paired with the notion that employers are demanding too much unpaid time and effort during the hiring process.\nJob applications, which could require a resume, cover letter, references and multiple written responses to screener questions, may never reach human eyes. Employers often don't respond to most of the applications. And if they do, the argument goes, its probably going to be an automated email. So why wouldnt you automate your cover letter?\n\"As a job seeker, you have only a limited amount of time to apply,\" Javier tells Money. Obviously, you want to have a killer resume, he says, but he advises applicants not obsess over the cover letter because that's the part of the application he says hiring managers are most likely to ignore.\nAlison Green, creator of the work-advice site Ask a Manager, says that sentiment is valid, as job hunters really are being asked to jump through an ever-growing number of hoops and produce lots of unpaid work upfront.\nSo of course people are looking for shortcuts, and of course theres a bit of an F-you in there toward employers, Green says. People feel like: If I can game the system, why shouldnt I?\nChatGPT is no doubt an easy-to-use shortcut for cover letters, but is it a good idea to use?

TopResume carefully crafts your career story to target the job that you want to land. Click below to get started.\nGet Started\nShould you use ChatGPT to write your cover letter?\nThe question of whether to use ChatGPT to write your cover letter is really implicitly two questions: Is it ethical? And is it practical?\nAs for the ethical portion? Experts are split, but its certainly a gray area.\nAlex Alonso, the chief knowledge officer at the Society for Human Resource Management, says that these types of ethical questions are just now catching some momentum among hiring managers as the industry begins to grapple with the use of AI during the hiring process.\nAs a result, there's not a firm consensus around the ethics yet. Alonso, who holds a Ph.D. in industrial and organizational (aka workplace) psychology, says \"it's an 'it depends' answer.\"\nHe explains that in some cases a ChatGPT-written cover letter might be permissible, particularly in tech fields. Using it could show the employer that youre familiar with the technology. However, he says you should always disclose that you used it.\nIf you share that information and somebody feels comfortable with it, that's perfectly okay, he says, but in other cases it could be unethical, especially in the case that youre trying to pass off the cover letter as your own work.\n(For what it's worth, ChatGPT itself also recommends going the disclosure route. \"It's important to be transparent about the role that a language model like me played in the creation of a cover letter, and to make sure that the final product accurately reflects your own qualifications, skills, and experiences,\" the chatbot said when asked if using it for cover letters is ethical.)\nGreen, of Ask a Manager, also notes that the ethics become more of an issue depending on the field. In certain writing-heavy industries, she says, more weight is placed on the cover letter, and its often considered a sample of your writing.\n\"If you submit a sample of your writing for a writing-heavy job and you didn't write it  I mean, you're just setting yourself up for disaster, Green says.\nFor Liz Ryan, CEO of the career coaching and consulting firm Human Workplace, the ethical question is basically irrelevant. Ryan views the ethical debate around ChatGPT as the next iteration of debate about using a resume writing service to help with your job application.\nIt used to be scandalous, Ryan says. Like, Oh, you paid somebody to do this?\nThese days, nobody bats an eye about using those types of services.\nAds by Money.

And I would say no, its really dumb.\nThats because experts say a good cover letter doesnt regurgitate your resume and is hyper specific to the job you want. It should rely on well-thought-out personal anecdotes that connect with the reader.\nIdeally, your cover letter should tell us a story because people are attracted to stories, Ryan says. And thats where ChatGPT can fall short. It doesnt know your unique experiences and cant make them up for you.\nWhat it can do very well is spit out a few quick paragraphs that will make the eyes of even the most corporate of hiring managers glaze over in boredom. Ryan says cover letters get such a bad rap because theyre already rife with jargon and boilerplate language. Feeding that already stodgy language into an AI is essentially creating a dreadful, rob",

      "body": "Reddit\narticle\nA book of poems lies on a screen on which the homepage of ChatGPT is called up. (Photo by Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -\nThe maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.\nThe new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPTs ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.\nOpenAI cautions that its new tool  like others already available  is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text \"is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes,\" said Jan Leike, head of OpenAI's alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.\n\"Because of that, it shouldnt be solely relied upon when making decisions,\" Leike said.\nRELATED:\nChatGPT may be smart enough to graduate law school\nTeenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAI's website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.\nBy the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public\nschool district\ns began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.\nThe Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.\n\"We cant afford to ignore it,\" Robinson said.\nThe district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a \"personal tutor\" or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.\nSchool districts\naround the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.\n\"The initial reaction was OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT,\" said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that \"this is the future\" and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\n\"I think we would be nave if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power,\" said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the company's detection service is in place.\nRELATED:\nClothing line created to trick AI facial recognition into thinking you're an animal\nOpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.\nThe longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text -- a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellisons \"Invisible Man\" --- and the tool will label it as either \"very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely\" AI-generated.\nBut much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, its not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.\n\"We dont fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally,\" Leike said. \"Theres really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.\"\nRELATED:\nHigher education institutions\naround the world also have begun debating responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of Frances most prestigious universities, prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using ChatGPT and other AI tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.\nIn response to the backlash, OpenAI said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators.\n\"Like many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that its inappropriate for use in their classrooms,\" said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. \"We dont really push them one way or another. We just want to give them the information that they need to be able to make the right decisions for them.\"\nIts an unusually public role for the research-oriented San Francisco startup, now backed by billions of dollars in investment from its partner Microsoft and facing growing interest from the public and governments.\nFrances digital economy minister Jean-Nol Barrot recently met in California with OpenAI executives, including CEO Sam Altman, and a week later told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that he was optimistic about the technology. But the government minister  a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the French business school HEC in Paris  said there are also difficult ethical questions that will need to be addressed.\n\"So if youre in the law faculty, there is room for concern because obviously ChatGPT, among other tools, will be able to deliver exams that are relatively impressive,\" he said. \"If you are in the economics faculty, then youre fine because ChatGPT will have a hard time finding or delivering something that is expected when you are in a graduate-level economics faculty.\"\nHe said it will be increasingly important for users to understand the basics of how these systems work so they know what biases might exist.\n-",

Followed categories will be added to My News.\nSeveral prestigious private Adelaide schools have joined the artificial intelligence revolution by allowing students to use a new website, ChatGPT.\nPembroke School, Scotch College and Walford Anglican School are among independent South Australian schools which, like government and Catholic schools, will permit access for lessons.\nAssociation of Independent Schools SA (AISSA) chief executive Anne Dunstan said each of its members was determining the approach that is right for it in this evolving artificial intelligence space.\nChatGPT is certainly the focus of much debate in education circles, she said.\nWhilst this early iteration of the technology is in its testing phase and directed at those over 18 years old, I am certain educators in our schools are considering the implications of this technology in their teaching and students learning.\nMs Dunstan, a former principal of Pulteney Grammar School, said there were both opportunities and challenges posed by tools such as ChatGPT.\nAISSA is creating a repository of information and source materials to support South Australian independent schools to navigate these, he said.\nNewly appointed scotch College principal Trent Driver said the increasing prominence of ChatGPT will ask hard questions for schools and systems.\nConfirming Scotch would allow senior pupils to access the website, Mr Driver said it was inevitable that schools will embrace AI as a tool in education.\nAnd that is a good thing, as the education system should constantly be questioning how well it adapts in a changing world, he said.\nAny technology that changes how society accesses and evaluates information will impact on how learning occurs in schools, that is an inevitability.\nMr Driver said ChatGPT would force conversations about how student learning was assessed  and the tools which schools and educational systems should implement.\nPretending it is a passing fad, that we can somehow keep it out of classrooms or that it wont change aspects of how students learn is naive, he said.\nSince time immemorial schools have adapted to technological changes so that learning can be richer and broader in scope, and Chat GPT is no different.\nPembroke IT teacher Sam Porter with year 12 students Sofiya Karimov and Stuart Vass. Picture: Tom Huntley\nPembroke School principal Mark Staker said instead of arbitrary bans that are a zero-sum-game, his school also would embrace artificial intelligence.\nEducation is all about readying people for the world and situations that they will encounter beyond school, he said.\nAI is part of that world  we have known it is coming and yet we are somehow outraged and surprised by its arrival.\nActing head of digital learning and innovation Samuel Porter said it was imperative Pembroke staff and students approached AI and platforms such as ChatGPT with an open mind.\nMr Porter said there must be continuously developing approaches to teaching and learning.\nMore Coverage\nCatholic schools to embrace revolutionary essay-writing robot\nThis includes a balance of technical knowledge, practical skills and creativity, combined with investigation into social and ethical issues related to emerging technologies, he said.\nMr Porter said Pembroke would be proactive with what we can control and do our utmost to understand what we cannot.\nOriginally published as",

      "body": "1\ncomment\nThe biggest trend in tech in the last few months has been the rise of ChatGPT. The AI tool created by OpenAI launched late in 2022, and has reportedly caused Google to go into \"code red\" mode to create its own AI-based tools to combat it. However, one person who made a disruptive tool for Google in the past says that the company's search engine ad business is in grave danger.\nIn a Twitter thread, (via\nBGR\n) Paul Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, offers this prediction:\nGoogle may be only a year or two away from total disruption. AI will eliminate the Search Engine Result Page, which is where they make most of their money.\nHe predicts that typing in the typical search bar could, instead of sending you to a Google search engine page, simply use an AI-based auto-complete feature that will give you an answer to your question. That answer may also include a URL link to a website for more info.\nWhile an AI bot like ChatGPT will still use the search engine backend at Google, The company's massive ad business could be shut down if the AI doesn't send traffic to the search page itself. Buchheit compares what might happen to Google to what happened to the print Yellow Pages, which became obsolete very quickly with the rise of the Internet.\nMicrosoft already has big plans to use ChatGPT. Last week, the company announced a new multi-year partnership with OpenAI that will allow ChatGPT to access Microsoft's Azure cloud servers. At the same time, Microsoft will expand the use of ChatGPT on many of its consumer and enterprise products.\nSource: Twitter via",

      "body": "and colleges over fears that ChatGPTs ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.\nOpenAI cautions that its\n like others already available  is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes, said Jan Leike, head of OpenAIs alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.\nBecause of that, it shouldnt be solely relied upon when making decisions, Leike said.\nTeenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAIs website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.\nBy the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.\nThe Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.\nWe cant afford to ignore it, Robinson said.\nThe district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a personal tutor or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.\nSchool districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.\nThe initial reaction was OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT, said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that this is the future and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\nI think we would be nave if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power, said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the companys detection service is in place.\nOpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to\ndetect automated disinformation campaigns\nand other misuse of AI to mimic humans.\nThe longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text  a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man  and the tool will label it as either very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated.\nBut much like ChatGPT itself,\nwhich was trained\non a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, its not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.\nWe dont fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally, Leike said. Theres really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.\nHigher education institutions around the world also have begun debating responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of Frances most prestigious universities, prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using ChatGPT and other AI tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.\nIn response to the backlash, OpenAI said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators.\nLike many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that its inappropriate for use in their classrooms, said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. We dont really push them one way or another. We just want to give them the information that they need to be able to make the right decisions for them.\nIts an unusually public role for the research-oriented San Francisco startup, now",

      "body": "ChatGPT\n: the latest AI chatbot taking the world by storm.\nRecent discussion about ChatGPT has focused on the risk of students using it to cheat, and whether it should be allowed in schools and universities.\nBut there's yet another question ChatGPT has thrown up: that is, whether ChatGPT could be considered an academic author.\nIt might seem far-fetched, but several papers published recently have listed ChatGPT as an author, including an editorial published in the journal Nurse Education in Practice.\nLast year, some researchers also tried to list GPT-3 as an author on a paper it wrote about itselfbut they struggled with listing the \"author's\" telephone number and email, and had to ask GPT-3 if it had conflicts of interest.\nThe issue of AI authorship is now clearly on the minds of commercial academic publishers. Last week, both the Science and Nature journals declared their positions on the use of ChatGPT to generate articles.\nScience is updating its license and editorial policies to \"specify that text generated by ChatGPT (or any other AI tools) cannot be used in the work, nor can figures, images, or graphics be the products of such tools\".\nSimilarly, Nature has formulated the following\nprinciples\n:\n\"No LLM (large language model) tool will be accepted as a credited author on a research paper. That is because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility\"\n\"Researchers using LLM tools should document this use in the methods or acknowledgements sections. If a paper does not include these sections, the introduction or another appropriate section can be used to document the use of the LLM.\"\nThese are drastic steps which highlight a fast-moving issue. But why does it matter whether or not ChatGPT can author an academic paper?\nAuthorship: The currency of the academic realm\nTo understand this, it's important to first understand that authorship in academia isn't the same as authorship of, say, a newspaper article.\nThat's because researchers are not paid to publish papers. They're rewarded through successful grant applications, or through promotion, for the number of times they're listed as an author on an academic paper (and especially if the paper is published in a prestigious journal).\nIn the academic world, authorship doesn't necessarily mean having actually \"written\" the paperbut it should, ideally, reflect genuine involvement in the research process.\nIt also conveys responsibility for the contents of the paper. The 2018 Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research includes a guide on authorship which states:\nAll listed authors are collectively accountable for the whole research output. An individual author is directly responsible for the accuracy and integrity of their contribution to the output.\nThis raises the question: can an AI tool be held \"responsible\" for the content it produces? As an extreme example, if ChatGPT's \"contribution\" to a paper included an error that led to people dying, who would be held accountable?\nThere's also author order to consider. In most areas of research, the first-listed author is considered the lead author. Other disciplines have their own acknowledgement systems, which can include alphabetical listing.\nBut ChatGPT doesn't derive any career benefit from authorship, so where would that contribution sit within the relevant author order?\nCopyright issues\nThen there is the issue of copyright. Commercial academic publishing is a hugely profitable business that relies on authors signing over copyright to the publisher.\nThis is a commercial arrangement. The author retains their moral right to be listed as an author and to take responsibility for their work, while the publisher charges for access to it.\nThe question of whether an AI program can \"own\" copyright is being debated. Copyright differs across the world, but traditionally has required a human to generate the work.\nThere are echoes here of a US case in which it was debated whether a monkey who took a \"selfie\" could own copyright of the image. The decision was it could not.\nBrave new world\nThere's clearly a great deal of work that will need to happen to understand how AI tools will exist in our lives in the future.\nChatGPT isn't going anywhere. Even if it's banned from being acknowledged as an academic author, there's nothing to stop researchers using it in their research process. The academic community will need guidelines on how to manage this.\nThere are interesting parallels here with the open access movement. Many discussions about ChatGPT in educational settings point to a need to move away from the traditional essay as assessment, and instead concentrate on marking students for \"showing their work\".\nWe could see something similar in academia, where each aspect of the research is made openly available, with acknowledgement of the originator, including ChatGPT. Not only would this increase transparency, it would also reduce the over-reliance on authorship as a primary mechanism for rewarding researchers.\nWhere authorship is failing\nBecause of the value of having one's name on a paper, there has long been a concept of \"gift\" or \"honorary\" authorship.\nThis is where a person's name is added to the author list even if they didn't contribute to the paper. They may have been the person who obtained the research grant, or may have simply been added because they have a high profile and could increase the chances of the paper being published.\nTwo recent studies, one in Europe and one in Australia, reveal the level of pressure Ph.D. and early-career researchers are under to provide gift authorship. This supervisory pressure reflects what's happening at a larger scale.\nThere have also been alarming revelations about payment being exchanged for authorship, with prices depending on where the work will be published and the research area. Investigations into this are leading to a spate of retractions.\nThere are clearly significant issues around academic authorship worldwide. Perhaps the arrival of ChatGPT is a wake-up call; maybe it will be enough for the academic community to take a closer look at how things could be better.\nProvided by\nThe Conversation\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "description": "Of all the reactions elicited by ChatGPT, the chatbot from the American for-profit company OpenAI that produces grammatically correct responses to natural-language queries, few have matched those of educators and academics.",
      "body": "economy\nof knowledge governance, academic bans on ChatGPT's use are a proportionate reaction to the threat ChatGPT poses to our entire information ecosystem. Journalists and academics should be wary of using ChatGPT.\nBased on its output, ChatGPT might seem like just another information source or tool. However, in reality, ChatGPTor, rather the means by which ChatGPT produces its outputis a dagger aimed directly at their very credibility as authoritative sources of knowledge. It should not be taken lightly.\nTrust and information\nThink about why we see some information sources or types of knowledge as more trusted than others. Since the European Enlightenment, we've tended to equate scientific knowledge with knowledge in general.\nScience is more than laboratory research: it's a way of thinking that prioritizes empirically based evidence and the pursuit of transparent methods regarding evidence collection and evaluation. And it tends to be the gold standard by which all knowledge is judged.\nFor example, journalists have credibility because they investigate information, cite sources and provide evidence. Even though sometimes the reporting may contain errors or omissions, that doesn't change the profession's authority.\nThe same goes for opinion editorial writers, especially academics and other experts because theywedraw our authority from our status as experts in a subject. Expertise involves a command of the sources that are recognized as comprising legitimate knowledge in our fields.\nMost op-eds aren't citation-heavy, but responsible academics will be able to point you to the thinkers and the work\n. And those sources themselves are built on verifiable sources that a reader should be able to verify for themselves.\nTruth and outputs\nBecause human writers and ChatGPT seem to be producing the same outputsentences and paragraphsit's understandable that some people may mistakenly confer this scientifically sourced authority onto ChatGPT's output.\nThat both ChatGPT and reporters produce sentences is where the similarity ends. What's most importantthe source of authorityis not\nwhat\nhow\nthey produce it.\nChatGPT doesn't produce sentences in the same way a reporter does. ChatGPT, and other machine-learning, large language models, may seem sophisticated, but they're basically just complex autocomplete machines. Only instead of suggesting the next word in an email, they produce the most statistically likely words in much longer packages.\nThese programs repackage others' work as if it were something new. It does not \"understand\" what it produces.\nThe justification for these outputs can never be truth. Its truth is the truth of the correlation, that the word \"sentence\" should always complete the phrase \"We finish each other's \" because it is the most common occurrence, not because it is expressing anything that has been observed.\nBecause ChatGPT's truth is only a statistical truth, output produced by this program cannot ever be trusted in the same way that we can trust a reporter or an academic's output. It cannot be verified because it has been constructed to create output in a different way than what we usually think of as being \"scientific.\"\nYou can't check ChatGPT's sources because the source is the statistical fact that most of the time, a set of words tend to follow each other.\nNo matter how coherent ChatGPT's output may seem, simply publishing what it produces is still the equivalent of letting autocomplete run wild. It's an irresponsible practice because it pretends that these statistical tricks are equivalent to well-sourced and verified knowledge.\nSimilarly, academics and others who incorporate ChatGPT into their workflow run the existential risk of kicking the entire edifice of scientific knowledge out from underneath themselves.\nBecause ChatGPT's output is correlation-based, how does the writer know that it is accurate? Did they verify it against actual sources, or does the output simply conform to their personal prejudices? And if they're experts in their field, why are they using ChatGPT in the first place?\nKnowledge production and verification\nThe point is that ChatGPT's processes give us no way to verify its truthfulness. In contrast, that reporters and academics have a scientific, evidence-based method of producing knowledge serves to validate their work, even if the results might go against our preconceived notions.\nThe problem is especially acute for academics, given our central role in creating knowledge. Relying on ChatGPT to write even part of a column means they're no longer relying on the scientific authority embedded in verified sources.\nInstead, by resorting to statistically generated text, they are effectively making an argument from authority. Such actions also mislead the reader, because the reader can't distinguish between text by an author and an AI.\nChatGPT may produce seemingly legible knowledge, as if by magic. But we would be well advised not to mistake its output for actual, scientific knowledge. One should never confuse coherence with understanding.\nChatGPT promises easy access to new and existing knowledge, but it is a poisoned chalice.

      "body": "Updated:\n31/01/2023            -18:06\nWill artificial intelligence (AI) soon replace journalists? Many have been asking this question since the boom of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, which can write a high school essay. a poem, or even pass a medical licensing exam in a matter of seconds.\nNow, AI tools are seeping into newsrooms. CNET, an American tech news outlet, has acknowledged using AI to write financial articles, seemingly as early as November 2022.\nChatGPT: Is it possible to detect AI-generated text?\nWhen looking more closely at the articles on CNET, a disclaimer reads: \"This article was assisted by an AI engine and reviewed, fact-checked and edited by our editorial staff\".\nHowever, CNET announced last week it would pause its AI publishing experiment after spotting factual errors in articles.\n\"We identified additional stories that required correction, with a small number requiring substantial correction and several stories with minor issues,\" Connie Guglielmo, CNET's editor-in-chief, said in a statement.\nCNET did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.\nStudents are using ChatGPT to do their homework. Should schools ban AI tools, or embrace them?\nTo what extent could newsrooms use AI?\nAlthough the technology is still in its infancy, multiple AI experts believe newsrooms could benefit from the use of ChatGPT and similar tools.\n\"The areas where we could use AI are very limited, but they exist and we should see where it could be in our interest to use generative AI,\" said Ariane Bernard, project lead for data at the International News Media Association.\nI think that we should look at non-political and non-controversial subjects. If an AI gives bad advice on how to carry out DIY, its probably OK\nAriane Bernard\nInternational News Media Association\n\"I think that we should look at non-political and non-controversial subjects, not areas that really touch society in a meaningful way. Like lifestyle, which is not as contentious. If an AI gives bad advice on how to carry out DIY, its probably OK,\" Bernard told Euronews.\nBuzzfeed is the latest example of that. The news outlet is reportedly also planning to use artificial intelligence to personalise and enhance its online quizzes.\n\"We are not using AI to generate content; it's a tool some of our quiz writers are using to apply it to an entirely new quiz format,\" said a Buzzfeed spokesperson.\n\"All our quizzes remain written by humans, in this new format AI will be applied to the quiz results to change and enhance the quiz experience, creating an infinite number of possible responses\".\nCan AI replace journalists?\nShould we be worried about artificial intelligence writing the articles we read online?\nGael Breton, the digital marketing and SEO expert who first spotted CNET's use of AI, thinks it's time for everyone to start adapting to this new technology.\n\"Is it good or bad? [It] doesn't matter because it's happening anyway. What matters is how we use this technology and how we make sure it's not used to spread fake news,\" he told Euronews.\n\"I think we need to understand how it works, learn how to use it - because there's no way we can get rid of it\".\nThe power of the editorial publishers will endure. This has parallels to the great promise of blogging forever disrupting journalism that never came to fruition\nEddie Kim\nFounder and CEO, Memo\nBreton believes it will be up to Google and other search engines to sift through human and AI-generated content and reward the former when it comes to which articles appear first when users search for information.\nBreton says he compared how Google was referencing human writers versus AI-generated content by CNET, and that reporters were vastly outperforming AI text in Google search results.\n\"AI cannot output an article on a major website today without human oversight, so we're not at the point where editors will get rid of human writers and replace them with AI,\" he said.\nMusicLM: Googles new AI tool can turn text, whistling and humming into actual music\nEddie Kim, CEO of Memo, a company that uses AI to analyse new articles, believes that it's the evergreen and informational content that will be most at risk.\n\"The power of the editorial publishers will endure. So much of the product that premium publishers offer is their masthead and authority. The same words living elsewhere simply dont carry the same weight or prominence,\" Kim told Euronews.\n\"Everyone could just write their own articles about themselves. This has parallels to the great promise of blogging forever disrupting journalism that never came to fruition\".\nCopy/paste the article video embed link below:\nCopy",

      "body": "Comment\nThe language in Nature was pretty mild as far as freakouts go. ChatGPT and other similar A.I. tools, the editors wrote, threaten the transparency and trust-worthiness that the process of generating knowledge relies on  ultimately, research must have transparency in methods, and integrity and truth from authors. The editor of Natures chief rival, Science, similarly blew his stack in a most genteel manner: An AI program cannot be an author. A violation of these policies will constitute scientific misconduct no different from altered images or plagiarism of existing works, he wrote.\nAdvertisement\nThese might seem like gentle warnings, but to academics who submit research papers to peer-reviewed journals like Science and Nature, the specter of being charged with research misconductpotentially a career-wrecking accusationfor using A.I. is about as subtle as an air-raid siren. Its a bright red neon sign saying, in all caps, Dont go there.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAll this pearl-clutching isnt the result of a hypothetical problem. Just a few days earlier, Natures journalists had covered how ChatGPT-written abstracts were science-y enough to fool fellow scientists, and, worse, that A.I.-co-authored articles were already working their way into the peer-reviewed literature. Just as university teachers have already started finding ChatGPT-written essays in the wild and journalists have been discovering A.I.-written news articles, scientific journals suddenly realized that the abstract threat of machine-written research articles was already becoming very, very concrete. It seems like were just weeks away from a tsunami of fake papers hitting the peer-reviewed literature, swamping editors and drowning the scientific process in an ocean of garbage.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe journals are absolutely right to worry; ChatGPT and, presumably, its A.I. successors yet to come represent a potential existential threat to the peer review processa fundamental mechanism that governs how modern science is done. But the nature of that challenge isnt fundamentally about the recent, rapid improvement in A.I. mimicry as much as it is about a much slower, more insidious disease at the heart of our scientific processthe same problem that makes A.I. such a threat to university teaching and to journalism.\nAdvertisement\nChatGPT isnt the first research-paper-writing machine to drive journal editors to distraction. For nearly two decades, computer science journals have been plagued with fake papers created by a computer program written by MIT grad students. To use this program, named SCIgen, all you have to do is enter one or more names and, voil, the program automatically spits out a computer science research paper worthy of submission to a peer-reviewed journal or conference. Worthy, that is, if none of the peer reviewers bothered to actually read the paper. SCIgen-written articles were so transparently nonsense that anyone with the slightest expertise in computer science should have spotted a hoax before finishing the first paragraph. Yet not only were SCIgen papers regularly getting past the peer review process and into the pages of scientific journals, it was happening so regularly that, in the mid-2010s, journals deployed an automated detector to try to stem the tide. Nowadays, unretracted SCIgen papers are harder to find, but you can still spot them in bottom-feeder journals every\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBack then, the real story wasnt about how sophisticated SCIgen was; after all, it was a simple script that could only create a really poor facsimile of a research article, one that shouldnt fool anyone who belonged within 10 feet of a computer science journal. As I wrote in Slate eight years ago, The likelihood of a real computer scientist being fooled by a SCIgen paper is roughly the same as that of a classicist mistaking pig Latin for an undiscovered Cato oration. A SCIgen paper shouldnt pass even the most cursory peer review by the most clueless peer in the field. Yet here, too, the journal editors were freaking out to the point of deploying automated defenses against SCIgen attacks.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThis says way more about the peer review process than it does about the state of computer mimicry. In theory, the idea of the peer review process is that a scientific claim needs to be vetted by two or three or more scientists of similar stature who prod the research and look for errors, logical holes, and other problems. (According to scientific legend, reviewer No. 2 is always hard to please.) Peer review is a quality-control measure thats supposed to ensure that what gets published meets a certain minimum standardnot that the research is right, but that its not obviously wrong, and that it has some value in advancing knowledge in the field. And thats why peer-reviewed publications are so much more valued in science than unvetted, preprint articles: By putting its imprimatur on an article, a peer-reviewed journal is telling the scientific world that that minimum standard is met. And for the most prestigious journals in the scientific world, Science and Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine and the like, those minimum standards are supposed to be quite high.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBut vetting a scientific document takes a lot of thought and work, and the scientists who do it arent generally paid by the journals theyre doing all this labor for. It shouldnt come as a surprise that often theyor the graduate students they\ndragoon into doing the work for them\ndont always do the best job of review. And as the number of publications and paper submissions increases, the pool willing to do serious peer reviews is being spread thinner and thinner. Its a scaling problem: The process of vetting information is what gives the peer-reviewed journal its valuebut because doing that process well is so labor-intensive, its a bottleneck that cant expand in the same way that the journals themselves are. The result is an almost inevitable decline in the quality of peer review. However, most journals are more than willing to take the hit, as the quality of peer review is mostly invisible. For most, the only sign that things are amiss is when obvious garbage starts getting past the gatekeepersthe gatekeepers that are the whole point of the journal in the first place.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWhat ChatGPT is doing, like SCIgen before it, is generating BS that should (at least at this point) fail a serious peer review. Sure, ChatGPT and its A.I. siblings are orders of magnitude more sophisticated than SCIgen, but if you cut through the verbiage, much of what these programs produce is wrong, even nonsensical. They make up facts and generate fake sources to back up their lies. A proper peer review, which checks references and vets facts, should catch the problem.\nTake, for example, one of the peer-reviewed papers Nature describedCan GPT-3 write an ",

      "body": "January 31, 2023 at 12:18 PM\nShares\n0\nAldous Huxleys dystopian masterpiece Brave New World was published more than 90 years ago. It was set well into the future, and the worlds population is separated into classes based primarily upon intelligence. The storys protagonist, Bernard Marx, discovers the world outside of the class system. Contrasted with Jules Vernes more optimistic novels about the future, Huxleys Brave New World sees the negative aspects of a society enabled by technology. Huxley anticipated a number of developments, but he did not anticipate computers and artificial intelligence. I wonder how Huxleys novel would have been different if he had.\nAIs role in the evolution of legal technology has been much discussed in recent months. Last month, I shared in Are The Robots Finally Here the game-changing potential of ChatGPT, including some potential applications, inherent limitations of the technology, and the potential for nefarious elements to use AI for negative purposes. After publication, a colleague of mine pointed to the phenomenon of AI Hallucinations, in which AI literally makes up answers including fictitious sources for its work. Dr. Lance Eliot at Stanford University is a renowned expert on AI who also writes about AI ethics, AI legal considerations and responsible AI. He has a simple approach to the ethical issues:\nThomson Reuters and Above the Law\nPure AI Has Limitations, But Hybrid AI Solutions Coupled With Human Input Can Win The Day\nPure AI solutions like ChatGPT will have limits unless they are augmented by another technology and overseen by humans. By Pure AI, Im referring to the use of a singular AI technology, rather than a heterogenous mix of technologies that includes AI and is augmented with other rules or logic. When another technology is better for the task at hand, it should be used. I would call this Hybrid AI  applications where the AI is an important part of the technology but not the only technology.\nIt is unclear how many rules (if any) are embedded into ChatGPT right now. Does ChatGPT know to put legal disclaimers on its results? Did legal counsel at OpenAI trust the AI enough to let it learn about legal disclaimers and trust ChatGPT to make such disclaimers? Or are their rules and logic embedded to make sure that a legal disclaimer is included in any response that ChatGPT outputs that could be construed as legal advice? The answers to questions like these are unclear.\nOpenAI could be made much stronger with a rules engine that can box in AI and force the application to apply prescriptive steps to its outputs. That would be very important for domains like legal, health, risk compliance, or science where there are facts that are known.\nSponsored\nEthan Beberness\nAI Can Leverage What Is Already Known\nThink about it. There isnt a need to depend upon AI to discover facts are already known. Something like the exact language of a codified law or the interaction of two prescription drugs does not need to be learned by AI. It is already known. When AI recognizes certain patterns, such as a legal question, the application should be directed to leverage rules and provide references to work that is authoritative, like a citation to a codified law.\nTaking those steps raises another issue. How do we know that rules within an application arent biased or incorrect? What if the application applies the wrong rules? The reality is that we dont always know those answers ourselves in the real world.\nBut rules and logic can be researched and verified if they are disclosed. This is true in the real world and within applications that provide transparency. Society generally trusts the legal system and clients generally trust attorneys and judges. The same is true for our healthcare system; its not perfect, but we tend to trust our doctors or hospitals to do right by us. And if there is a significant enough issue with a ruling or a health decision, there are review processes that enable a review.\nFor all the scariness out there with AI, as more Hybrid AI is developed that leverages facts and known information with rules, the future will be much brighter.\nSponsored\nThomson Reuters and Above the Law\nHere is a quick example of how Hybrid AI could be used to solve a legal problem. An attorneys bot receives an inquiry via chat from a client. Throughout the course of the chat, client intake occurs and the bot concludes that the clients issue is related to bankruptcy. As a Hybrid AI solution, the bot now begins to ask specific questions and applies known rules to complete existing forms that are specifically tied to bankruptcy filings. The attorney receives information and conducts a review of the entire process, clarifies anything that needs to be changed, communicates with the client, and puts her stamp of approval on the filing. An experience like this is not farfetched and could provide a faster, more efficient pathway for attorneys to work with their clients.\nWho Will Benefit From Hybrid AI Approaches?\nId like to think that society will, and Im admittedly an optimist. Within the legal community, a Hybrid AI approach would benefit lawyers, law firms and law departments.\nLegal information providers who are a trusted part of the legal community and produce authoritative materials will benefit. Lawyers and judges who rely upon these will benefit too.\nNo-code and low-code software platforms benefit because of their rules-based technology, as will any organization that has a repository of factual information to leverage. This can include law departments with their policy documents and contract lifecycle management solutions. It can also include law firms that have extensive databases of prior work product across all types of matters and clients.\nThere is a lot of talk about AI being disruptive and scary. AI will indeed be disruptive, but Hybrid AI has a lot of positive potential. Hybrid AI solutions can help leverage established facts and authoritative work that doesnt have to be rediscovered by AI. If Hybrid AI applications can take off, there will still be new entrants in the legal industry  but many stakeholders will be able to embrace, benefit, and thrive from Hybrid AI technologies.\nUnlike in Huxleys Brave New World, there are reasons to believe the future of the legal industry holds the promise for even more positive possibilities. I believe AI for Good can triumph over AI for Bad.\nKen Crutchfield is Vice President and General Manager of Legal Markets at Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S., a leading provider of information, business intelligence, regulatory and legal workflow solutions.

Its not perfect, but it was a great starting point. My background is in technology and writing something eloquent takes time. This made it so much easier.\nChatGPT Is a Scarily Convincing AI Chatbot\nOne week after launch, it hasn't been hard to get the AI-powered chatbot to suggest some pretty awful things, such as wiping out humans\nIt appears that the AI tool is useful in ways that seem pretty obvious. Besides listing, a few human prompts can help realtors write social media posts, draft legal documents and automate repetitive tasks such as answering frequently asked questions and doing complex calculations. Theres already a YouTube how-to for realtors about using the AI tool.\n(The realtors who spoke to CNN did note that they read everything the chatbot creates, and they also sent the generated responses to lawyers for legal advice.)\nThe AI is also helpful in giving quick answers. I can be in a car with a client when they ask me what their mortgage payments might be, says Frank Trelles, a commercial real estate agent. I can ask ChatGPT what a mortgage payment would be on a $14 million purchase at a 7.2% interest rate amortized over 25 years with two origination points at closing, and in two seconds, it gives me that information. It also explains how it got the answer. Its amazing.\nStill, ChatGPT is a work in progress and has been proven to be wrong before (even with\nmath\n).

      "body": "NYC public school officials are expected to announce a new policy on ChatGPT that could reverse a prior ban and be much more accepting of artificial intelligence in classrooms, Chancellor David Banks said Tuesday. The AI-powered chatbot, released in November, quickly ignited a debate over its use in schools -- weighing its potential as a teaching tool against its capacity for cheating and plagiarism. We put a pause on it for just a moment to say, we needed a minute just to kind of study this, Banks told PIX11. Because our concern was that students would just use this technology, and it can write all your essays and do anything else that you want it to do. And that doesnt help us understand if our kids actually are developing the knowledge and the skills that they need. Chancellor David Banks speaking during a press conference at DOE Headquarters on Wednesday, March 2, 2022 in Manhattan. The education department blocked access to ChatGPT on its devices and Wi-Fi this month, as first reported by Chalkbeat. Officials later clarified that individual schools could request to have the website unblocked. I dont necessarily see it for bad, said Banks. I just see it as challenge. We cant run from it. Weve got to get out in front of it. Weve got to make sure we put the safeguards around it, and then have the maximum impact for good. Thats what were focused on, he added. Public perception of artificial intelligence in NYC schools is still evolving. Nearly 42% of respondents to an informal social media poll by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine this month threw their support behind the education department ban. Over 600 Twitter users voted. More than a third said they disagreed with the policy, while a quarter responded that they were undecided. Many education technology experts have warned that banning the technology outright may put kids in school at a disadvantage as they prepare for future careers using artificial intelligence systems. Its defenders also argue that any ban is unlikely to be effective, as students of means can use their own technology at home to get around the filter. It is part of the innovation wave, said Banks. And it is a wave of the future. Were all going to have to get used to it. Several large school districts have taken a similar approach to New Yorks. Los Angeles Unified School District temporarily blocked access in December while officials assess benefits and the risks. School systems in Baltimore and Seattle also put the brakes on the platform. A spokesperson for the NYC school system declined to weigh in on what guardrails officials are considering, and who is involved in making decisions about the technology: Will have more to say when we have more to say, said press secretary Nathaniel Styer.",

      "description": "Facing pressure from educators, OpenAI released a tool that tries to tell whether pasted text was machine-generated..",
      "body": "OpenAI has released a tool to help you determine whether text was more likely written by a human or AI. However, the ChatGPT maker warns that its equivalent of Blade Runners Voight-Kampff test can also get it wrong.\nThe tool includes a box where you can paste text thats at least 1,000 characters long. It will then spit out a verdict, like The classifier considers the text to be very unlikely AI-generated or The classifier considers the text to be possibly AI-generated.\nI tested it by prompting ChatGPT to write an essay about the migratory patterns of birds, which the detection tool then described as possibly AI-generated. Meanwhile, it rated several human-written articles as very unlikely AI-generated. So although the tool could raise false flags in either direction, my (tiny sample size) test suggests at least a degree of accuracy. Still, OpenAI cautions not to use the tool alone to determine contents authenticity; it also works best with text of 1,000 words or longer.\nThe startup has faced pressure from educators after the November release of its ChatGPT tool, which produces AI-written content that can sometimes pass for human writing. The natural-language model can create essays in seconds based on simple text prompts  even passing a graduate business and law exam  while providing students with a tempting new cheating opportunity. As a result, New York public schools banned the bot from their WiFi networks and school devices.\nOpenAI\nWhile ChatGPTs arrival has been a buzzed-about topic of late, even extending into media outlets eager to automate SEO-friendly articles, the bot is big business for OpenAI. The company reportedly secured a $10 billion investment earlier this month from Microsoft, which plans to integrate it into Bing and Office 365. OpenAI allegedly discussed selling shares at a $29 billion valuation late last year, which would make it one of the most valuable US startups.\nAlthough ChatGPT is currently the best publicly available natural language AI model, Google, Baidu and others are working on competitors. Googles LaMDA is convincing enough that one former researcher threw away his job with the search giant last year by claiming the chatbot is sentient. (The human tendency to project feelings and consciousness onto algorithms is a concept well likely hear much about in the coming years.) Google has only released extremely constricted versions of its chatbot in a beta, presumably out of ethical concerns. With the genie out of the bottle, it will be interesting to see how long that restraint lasts.",

      "body": "ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, and we could not be more excited. Today, were revealing the customer service features we have built using this revolutionary AI.\n\nsat down to chat about the launch of ChatGPT\n: the good, the bad, the promise, the hype. The possibilities to automate and streamline processes for support reps seem endless, but the success of generative AI in this space will ultimately depend on its ability to deliver real value for customer service teams and customers alike. If not, well, its just a toy  a fun one, but a toy nonetheless.\nTo test this, we quickly got down to work. We sketched out a few AI-powered features we thought could be useful, went into production, and put a beta version in front of 160 customers. You can read all about these new features here.\nIn todays episode, Fergal and I share what weve learned in the past few weeks, where were going next, and how it has changed our perception of whats possible in this space.\n Click here to join the beta waitlist for our AI features or receive AI news from Intercom.\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\nThe ability of ChatGPT models to process natural language in multi-sentence conversations continues to improve and unlock new possibilities.\nIn product development, customers are always the ultimate arbiter  you may build amazing technology, but if it doesnt solve a problem for them, its not worth it.\nThe ability of GPT-3.5 to edit and change text makes it very valuable for customer service, and it can already handle tasks such as summarizing text and adjusting tone.\nWith advances in ChatGPT, more features may be added to maximize efficiency and free frontline agents to focus on the more complex issues that drive customer satisfaction.\nWhile were starting to investigate potentially game-changing uses such as smart replies, the model still lacks an understanding of the business context for it to work.\nMake sure you dont miss any highlights by following Inside Intercom on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or grabbing the RSS feed in your player of choice. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the episode.\nA breakthrough in language understanding\nDes Traynor: Hello once again, Fergal. How are you?\nFergal Reid: Good, thanks, Des. Been a busy last sort of six or seven weeks here at Intercom, so Im very excited to talk about that today.\nDes: Yeah, just six or seven weeks ago we sat down to chat. Youve had, I guess, six or seven weeks of actual engineering time building against the AI revolution that launched in late November. What have you learned? Has it changed your perception of whats going to be possible in the world of customer service?\nFergal: Yeah, I think it has. When we talked last, we talked a lot about ChatGPT and that was maybe a week after it was launched. You can split hairs about whether the big difference here is ChatGPT or the family of models OpenAI has built  weve been working mostly with GPT-3.5 or with Text-Davinci-003, to be really specific.\nDes: Theyre names of this specific module.\nFergal: Yeah, theyre the names of this specific model. And actually, theres a lot of confusion over these names and what the different things are. But basically, we feel that the GPT-3.5 series of models, Davinci-002, Davinci-003, this sort of thing, which have come out in the last year, and then Davinci-003, which dropped at the exact same time as ChatGPT, were breakthroughs and really have enabled us to start trying to build different, qualitatively better functionality.\nThats a big unlock because there are so many tasks that we want to do that are best described in natural language\nDes: What is your belief about whats possible now? Where are we headed in the world of customer service?\nFergal: I think in customer service, and even beyond, these models enable us to deal with natural language in a better way than we could before. I guess I could give a little history of natural language processing. It was simple things like regular expressions and so on for a long time. Then we had text that got really good at looking at keywords that were in data a lot. And then maybe three, four years ago, neural networks started to get really good at understanding, Hey, whats the meaning of this sentence? But now, I would say theyre starting to get really good at Hey, whats the meaning of that sentence in a deeper heading much closer towards how humans can do it, and understanding whats going on in a conversation of multiple sentences. Whats the person talking about? Stitching together the contents of sentence one with the contents of sentence three to figure out that someone just said, Oh, I have a question about Salesforce. And the teammate says,  Well, whats your question? How can I help you? And then it says, Yeah, I really need help with my integration. And the systems are getting much better at understanding that that integration is about the Salesforce integration, and have some idea of where the conversation should go next.\nSuddenly, machines are able to look at those and make much more sense of them\nOur Resolution Bot and the machine learning tech thats already deployed are pretty good at that stuff within a given sentence. But now, the tech is getting better to the point where its good across multiple sentences and much better at context. As humans who communicate and want to talk to each other in natural languages, its just so natural to us. Thats a big unlock because there are so many tasks that we want to do that are best described in natural language. There are so many documents and instructions and articles about how to do something that we write and communicate with each other in natural language. And now, suddenly, machines are able to look at those and make much more sense of them. And each time that capability gets better, a whole lot of products unlock a whole lot of stuff that wasnt possible before. And we really feel that whats happened is a big thing. Thats our opinion until we build stuff and put it in front of our customers and see what our customers think of it.\nDes: And so thats what we want.\nFergal: I mean, thats what weve been trying to do.\nDes: What is software but codified opinions, right?\nFergal: Right.\nIts up to the customers\nDes: So, what have we built? What have you been working on? Lets talk through it.\nFergal: So, in product development, you always want to check your opinion. Your customers are always the ultimate arbiter of whether something is good or not. You might think youve got the most amazing technology and the most amazing product experience, but if it doesnt solve a problem and if it isnt used, youre wrong. And so, we really wanted to cut through the hype here and convince ourselves, Okay, what can we build for customers quickly, what can we get in front of them, to work with them to see whatever the value is? And so, we went and sketched out features that we could build and get into production quickly that would use some of this new tech and",

(Image: Tada Images, Shutterstock)\nTheres a lot of opinions flying around about the pros and cons of the future of ChatGPT, but Arvind Narayanan  a computer science professor from Princeton University  thinks the hype is still overblown at this point.\nIn an interview with The Markup last week, Narayanan expanded on his previous claim that ChatGPT is a bullshit generator in his newsletter on AI snake oil. Narayanan argues that since ChatGPT isnt trained to produced true text, its trained to produce plausible text  accuracy is a side effect of its goal of being persuasive. This means that ChatGPTs output might usually sound correct but will eventually fail spectacularly and produce blatant misinformation, which Narayanan says isnt a good fit for something like education, or journalism.\nCNET has been publishing articles written by AI without proper disclosure, as many as 75 articles, and some turned out to have errors that a human writer would most likely not have made, Narayanan said to The Markup. This was not a case of malice, but this is the kind of danger that we should be more worried about where people are turning to it because of the practical constraints they face. When you combine that with the fact that the tool doesnt have a good notion of truth, its a recipe for disaster.\nNarayanan likens ChatGPTs skills to that of DALLE-Es. He says that AI used to simply be able to make the distinction between two images, but with new technology, AI can reverse that process and create an image of a cat or a dog. ChatGPT behaves much the same way, but with text  instead of finding the differences between two passages, it can produce entirely new ones. While this may indicate that the technology and abilities of ChatGPT are still in its infancy, Narayanan is aware that people are concerned about how AI could revolutionise the workforce, or worse, cost them their job.\nSome jobs have gotten more efficient.

Even with something as profound as the internet or search engines or smartphones, its turned out to be an adaptation, where we maximise the benefits and try to minimise the risks, rather than some kind of revolution. I dont think large language models are even on that scale.\nChatGPT has seen a growing wave of popularity since its public release just a few months ago, a level of popularity that has even shocked its creators. In that time, people have begun to experiment with the different skills of the chatbot. In the case of ChatGPT taking a Wharton MBA level final exam, the AI passed, but demonstrated some clear issues with 6th grade arithmetic. While the AI revolution is upon us, a complete takeover of the human workforce isnt imminent.\nShare this Story",

      "description": "Seeing the enormous potential of the technology, the industry is either rushing to adopt ChatGPT in applications or trying to come up with alternatives.",
      "body": "When it was introduced, ChatGPTs ability to break down complex problems and explain everything in a human-like manner led many to proclaim that Googles days as the numero uno search engine are numbered. While thats debatable, ChatGPTs impact on the industry is undeniable. Seeing the boundless potential of the technology, Microsoft is not only bringing out its investment guns but is also planning on integrating ChatGPT into its products. But, these are only a couple of examples  the impact of the AI chatbot is more reaching, and today we check out how the wider industry is responding to its advent. Google ups the ante against ChatGPT Where Google serves up a list of internet links in response to your queries, ChatGPT goes the extra mile in providing information in clear, simple sentences that are much easier to understand. Add to that the ability to generate content from scratch. While theres still plenty of room for improvement, the technology and its potential has got Google on the edge. The company reportedly declared a code red fearing that the AI chatbot could disrupt its search business. A report from The New York Times states that Google has called in help from founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help fight the AI threat. The duo has reportedly approved plans and pitched ideas to add chatbot features to Google. They also offered advice to company leaders, who are altering existing plans and increasing investment in the development of AI. The company plans to launch over 20 new AI products and even showcase a version of Google with chatbot abilities. However, even as the idea to include chatbot in search is new, Google will not be the first to do so when it does. Search engines like NeevaAI and You.com have already beaten Google at the game, although both are currently offering that service in beta. Meanwhile, Google is the current dominant search engine with billions of users and will likely only adopt the technology once it's more confident in its accuracy. This is apparent from the fact that Google already has been working on language model technology for years as part of its LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) project, albeit in a less flashy manner. Microsoft pours more money into AI and ChatGPT Microsoft has a less competitive relationship with ChatGPT. The Redmond-based company has made significant investments over the past years in OpenAI, ChatGPTs creator  $1 billion in 2019 and then another $2 billion in the years since. The $3 billion has been paid for the massive computing power that OpenAI needed to build the chatbot. More recently, the company announced that it's making another $10 billion investment, this time over several years. The announcement came less than a week after the company said it was laying off 10,000 workers amid poor economic conditions. Armed with the ChatGPT advantage, Microsoft is now finally in a position to challenge big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple. The company is preparing to add the chatbot to its Bing search engine in an attempt to pull users from Google. Bings market share currently is only a tiny fraction of what Google enjoys, and Microsoft seems to be betting big on the chatbot integration. The feature may be rolled in the next several months, even as theres still a long way to go before ChatGPT is deemed reliable enough. The initial release may, therefore, be limited to a narrow group of users. Microsoft also recently said that it will add ChatGPT to its cloud-based Azure service soon. Baidu aims to launch AI chatbot for its search engine in March Chinas search engine behemoth, Baidu, is also aiming to launch its AI chatbot, joining Microsoft and Google in what could be a race to set the stage for the next generation of search engines. According to a Bloomberg report from Sunday, Baidu is working on a ChatGPT-style application native to the search engine. This will roll out as early as March. With the tool, Baidu users will get to human-like responses to their queries, much like those that ChatGPT yields. Bloombergs source says that the tool will be built with ERNIE, Baidus own Large Language Model. Little is known about ERNIE right now because its capabilities have been kept hidden from the public.",

      "body": "February 1, 2023\nShare\nThe world will likely breach the internationally agreed-upon climate change threshold in about a decade and keep heating to break through a next warming limit around mid-century, even with big pollution cuts, artificial intelligence predicts in a new study thats more pessimistic than previous modeling.\nThe study in Mondays journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reignites a debate on whether its still possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as called for in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to minimize the most damaging effects of climate change. The world has already warmed 1.1 or 1.2 degrees since pre-industrial times, or the mid-19th century, scientists say.\nTwo climate scientists using machine learning calculated that Earth will surpass the 1.5-degree (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) mark between 2033 and 2035. Their results fit with other, more conventional methods of predicting when Earth will break the mark, though with a bit more precision.\nThere will come a time when we call the 1.5C target for maximum warming dead, beyond the shadow of a doubt, Brown University Environment Institute director Kim Cobb, who wasnt part of the study, said in an email interview. And this paper may be the beginning of the end of the 1.5C target.\nStanford Universitys Noah Diffenbaugh, a study co-author, said the world is on the brink of the 1.5-degree mark in any realistic emissions reduction scenario. Avoiding a 2-degree rise, he said, may depend on nations meeting zero-emissions goals by the middle of this century.\nThe artificial intelligence-based study found it unlikely that temperature increase could be held below 2 degrees Celsius, even with tough emissions cuts. And thats where the AI really differs with scientists who had been forecasting using computer models that are based on past observations, Diffenbaugh said.\nIn a high-pollution scenario, the AI calculated, the world would hit the 2-degree mark around 2050. Lower pollution could stave that off until 2054, the machine learning calculated.\nIn contrast, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change figured in its 2021 report that the same lower-pollution scenario would see the world pushing past 2 degrees sometime in the 2090s.\nCornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasnt part of the Diffenbaugh study but was part of the IPCC, said the study makes sense, fits with what scientists know, but seems a bit more pessimistic.\nTheres a lot of power in using AI, and in the future, that may be shown to produce better projections, but more evidence is needed before concluding that, Mahowald said.\nNormally, climate scientists use a bunch of computer model simulations, some running hot and some cold, and then try to figure out which ones are doing the best job. Thats often based on how they performed in the past or in simulations of the past, Diffenbaugh said. What the AI does is more keyed to the climate system now, he said.\nWere using this very powerful tool that is able to take information and integrate it in a way that no human mind is able to do, for better or for worse, Diffenbaugh said.\nEach year, government climate negotiators at a United Nations summit proclaim that they have managed to keep 1.5 alive. But with the latest study, theres a divide among scientists on how true that really is. Diffenbaugh said theres been so much warming already that it really doesnt matter how pollution is cut in the next several years. The world will hit 1.5, the AI figures.\nZeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth, who was not part of the study, agreed, saying its time to stop pretending that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is possible. Some scenarios do see temperatures warming past the mark but then coming back down, something called overshoot.\nOther scientists not involved with the study, such as University of Pennsylvanias Michael Mann and Climate Analytics Bill Hare and Carl-Friedrich Schleussner maintain 1.5 is still alive. They say one rapid decarbonization scenario that Diffenbaugh didnt examine shows the world can mostly keep under the threshold.\nIf the world can cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030 then warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees with a tiny overshoot and then reductions to get under the mark, Hare said.\nBelieving that the world can no longer keep warming below 1.5 is a self-fulfilling prophecy, Mann said by email. In the end its easy to overinterpret the significance of a precise threshold like 1.5C warming. The challenge is to limit warming as much as possible.\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated Press (AP)",
