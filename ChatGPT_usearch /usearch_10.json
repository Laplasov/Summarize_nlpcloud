      "body": ".\nThe t in ChatGPT, the hot new artificial intelligence tool, stands for transformer.\nGet ready for transformative real estate products from AI innovation that should improve the consumer real estate experience. But what exactly?\nHome search has already been transformed by some ho-hum AI applications. Recommendation engines being the most familiar, rendering house choices that better fit your needs and dreams. Your priorities during the house hunt will be baked into search results, including your personal preferences for nearby shops, amenities and safety. Seamless.\nSay hello to your personal lifestyle and home curator.\nFilters will be less important as the chatbot knows you better than you know yourself.\nAlso, expect transaction automation to get a lift like interactive smart contracts. AI promises to be a bureaucracy slayer.\nPredictive models will be enhanced by AI, such as figuring out what consumers want before they know it themselves. Insight on who will buy or sell when, and where the market might be headed. Conceptually old news, but now with better accuracy.\nWe should make progress automating data population from overlapping but disconnected datasets. AI machinery excels at complex math and memory skills. These reforms are already in motion as AI and the blockchain dance well together, like Baryshnikov and Kirkland.\nInformation, granular and high level, will permeate everything. But its ubiquitous characteristics will now be integrated into your life, without you asking for it.\nAI makes you smarter than you are.\nPractically speaking, generative artificial intelligence, which describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT), can be used to create new content, including audio, images, simulations and videos.\nSince much of real estate is about marketing, expect a lurch in creative new content about listings, neighborhoods and lifestyles, as words give way to images, 3D and enhanced virtual experiences.\nThe end game: Consumers will be better informed, doing much of your job themselves. With AI, DIY is getting a boost, as companies pass their work onto the public.\nLook no further than customer service. Its awash in do-it-yourself applications, without a human hand. With digital help, companies have decided to let you figure out their product and services on your own. Egads.\nIdeally, some of this should lead to faster and more efficient transactions. Agents should have more time to focus on the tough stuff and be less burdened by the mundane.\nPlus, home shopping will be more fun, fulfilling and multidimensional, supercharging homebuyer enthusiasm.\nTechnology is notorious for over-promising, and you can expect some lame and broken products along the way. And be wary of vendors who pitch AI, selling you duck-taped solutions that do nothing to improve your life.",

      "body": "A smart push into artificial intelligence (AI) was benefiting Microsoft\n(\n1.99%\n)\nand its shareholders on Wednesday. A business the tech company has placed a bet on announced a move aimed at capitalizing on its famous innovation, and investors were guardedly optimistic about that development.\nSo what\nArguably the most high-profile AI application on the scene today, ChatGPT is going commercial. OpenAI, the platform's developer, announced on its official blog that it's launching a pilot subscription plan called ChatGPT plus. Users who pay $20 per month will receive general and unfettered access to ChatGPT, even at peak times. OpenAI also promises faster response times and priority access to new features and upgrades in the system.\nChatGPT plus is now open for customers located in the U.S. OpenAI added that it will start inviting individuals on the service's waitlist in the coming weeks. It didn't get more specific about timing.\n\"We love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT,\" it added. \"By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access availability to as many people as possible.\"\nNow what\nAll this directly affects Microsoft, even if it hasn't yet had a significant impact. The tech giant is a key investor in OpenAI, having provided three rounds of investment into its business. The company has been coy about how much it's spent and whether this gives it an ownership stake of any meaningful size.\nRegardless, it's clear that AI is one of Microsoft's many ambitions. By being directly invested in OpenAI, it's backing a prize horse in the race.",

      "body": "Jan 31, 2023 / 05:52 PM CST\nEzra Anderson, 7, uses a tablet to communicate. Screenshot of 7-Ahead/Youtube\n(\nNewsNation\n) Seven-year-old Ezra pushes the icons on his tablet  an essential tool for his independence  and a computerized voice the tone and pitch of a little boy speaks out: I want cheese, please.\nI was in tears when we picked what type of voice would be his voice, said Holly Anderson of her son who has autism and does not speak.\nThe tablet allows Ezra to express his needs or preferences through a software that weaves pictures into sentences. Communicating this way can be slow and arduous  but has the potential to be completely revolutionized by a new artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, ChatGPT.\nAnalysis: Students lost 35% of school during pandemic\nThe advent of an advanced AI that seemingly can write like a human has led to fears of cheating, concerns over plagiarism and cries that itll be the end of critical thinking.\nYet within the disability community, the chatbots free and open-source nature has generated a lot of hope and excitement  particularly that this new technology gives people the ability to overcome barriers independently.\nLooking ahead to the teen years, that could mean help writing a resume and cover letter, or asking for advice on how to talk to a girlfriend, said Anderson, who runs a YouTube channel on parenting kids with autism with her husband Adam.\nIf he has the availability to go on ChatGPT, on an AI system, and ask a question and figure it out for himself, then he can be more independent in his life, she said. In so many ways, especially for people who have been disadvantaged in the past with a lot of limitations  this totally levels the playing field.\nAdam Anderson helps his son, Ezra, use a tablet that helps him learn and communicate. Screenshot of 7-Ahead/Youtube\nAdding the Fluff\nA slew of artificial intelligence programs have gone mainstream this year  from apps that can paint you a profile picture, to browser extensions that summarize search engine results into a paragraph.\nBut ChatGPT has stood out, in part due to its simple interface and extremely advanced language framework. It can distill the vast information of the internet into a seemingly human conversation, offering social awareness and even wisdom.\nIts the first chatbot thats enjoyable enough to speak with and useful enough to ask for information, said Big Technology newsletter writer Alex Kantrowitz. It can engage in philosophical discussions and help in practical matters. And its strikingly good at each.\nThe way ChatGPT mimics human polite conversation excites Fiona Given, a lawyer and research associate at the University of Technology Sydneyin Australia. She uses a speech device due to Cerebral Palsy and only averages about 18 words a minute. \nFiona Given, an Australian lawyer and researcher, uses a text-to-speech device to give a lecture. Courtesy of Fiona Given.\nDue to the effort that is required of me to compose my messages, I economize on words, Given said. This results in me only telling half a story or sounding curt because I leave out the nice fluffy parts of language. This can lead to breakdowns in communication or even breakdowns in relationships.\nPeople playing with ChatGTP have already demonstrated its ability to add that fluffy language into written words, like emails or school reports. Connecting the technology into a text-to-speech device is an obvious next step, Given said.\nIt could also help me provide detailed instructions to direct support workers such as how to assist me in the shower  how to cook my favorite dish, Given said. Often by the time I have typed my message, the conversation has moved on. AI technology could help me be a more active participant.\nHurdles Ahead\nAlthough ChatGPT is currently free and open-sourced, it still would require a developer to apply it to current technology on the market.\nThat would likely make it more expensive or create hurdles to access  like having to go through insurance, said Kara Ayers, of the University of Cincinnati Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities.\nAyers is also a parent and uses a wheelchair. Banning AI software from schools, jobs or government offices outright is short-sighted, she says, predicting itll become as indispensable as search engines.\nThat means its essential for developers to consider how people with disabilities will use it.\nPeople assume  that theres like this brigade of people waiting to help (people with disabilities), she said. Were not there yet. And so until we get there, I just potentially see ChatGPT as a bridge.\nStill, the nature of that bridge gets at a core question of authorship: What does it mean to co-create with a computer that thinks faster and knows more than you? What does it mean when the person reading or viewing that creation cant tell the difference between human hands and keystrokes?\nAbsolutely (ChatGPT) would increase my productivity, Given said, adding the world often misses out on the unique insights and experiences of people with disabilities. But its really important that the person with a disability edits (the output) so it is our own words.\n 1998 - 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.\nShare this story",

      "description": "OpenAI, the startup that created the text generator ChatGPT, launched a tool on Tuesday to identify text generated by artificial intelligence.",
      "body": "It's AI hunting AI. OpenAI, the startup that created the text generator ChatGPT, launched a tool on Tuesday to identify text generated by artificial intelligence.  The \"AI Text Classifier,\" as the company calls it, is a \"fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.  The classifier will label text as \"very likely,\" \"unlikely,\" \"unclear if it is,\" \"possibly,\" or \"likely\" AI-generated.  \"Our intended use for theAI Text Classifieris to foster conversation about the distinction between human-written and AI-generated content,\" the blog post said. \"The results may help, but should not be the sole piece of evidence, when deciding whether a document was generated with AI.\" ChatGPT, which became popular online late last year, is a free AI tool that can generate dialogue based on user prompts, and has gone viral for producing poems, recipes, emails and other text samples. The chat bot has passed graduate-level exams in multiple fields, including the final exam for the University of Pennsylvanias Master of Business Administration program and exams for four law courses at the University of Minnesota. It also performed comfortably within the passing range of the United States medical licensing exam. The accessibility and capabilities of ChatGPT have raised concerns among many educators. New York Citys Department of Education banned ChatGPT from school devices and networks earlier this month, citing concern over the negative impacts of student learning. A spokesperson for the department said that the tool can provide quick and easy answers to questions, but it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. Some schools and colleges have considered amending their honor codes to address the rise of ChatGPT and other text generators. That has also sparked efforts to create programs to detect AI-generated writing. Edward Tian, a senior at Princeton University, developed GPTZero late last year in an effort to combat AI plagiarism in academia. Earlier this month, plagiarism detection tool Copyleaks launched its own AI Content Detector for educational institutions and publishing. The Giant Learning Model Test Room, a 2019 collaboration between the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and the Harvard Natural Language Processing Group, identifies AI-generated writing using predictive text.  OpenAI's classifier has some limitations. Writing samples must be at least 1,000 characters, or about 150-250 words. The blog post noted that the tool isnt always accurate  AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection tools, and the text classifier may misidentify both AI-generated and human-written samples. OpenAI also acknowledged that the tool was trained using English text samples written by adults, so it may misidentify content written by children or in languages other than English.  OpenAI said that it has \"not thoroughly assessed\" the classifier's effectiveness in \"detecting content written in collaboration with human authors.\"   To train the text classifier model, OpenAI used human-written text from a Wikipedia dataset, a 2019 WebText dataset and human demonstrations that were used to train InstructGPT, another language model. The company said it used \"balanced batches that contain equal proportions AI-generated and human-written text\" to train the text classifier.  Still, OpenAi said that the classifier may be \"extremely confident in a wrong prediction,\" since it hasn't been \"carefully evaluated\" on \"principle targets\" like student essays, chat transcripts or disinformation campaigns.  \"Because of these limitations, we recommend that theclassifierbe used only as one factor out of many when used as a part of an investigation determining a piece of contents source,\" OpenAI said.",

      "body": "Recently, the platform introduced new AI tools for freelancers. The brands open letter, published in 'The New York Times', calls for coordination between AI and humans.A week ago, global online marketplace Fiverr introduced new artificial intelligence (AI) categories on the platform in the wake of the AI revolution. To amplify the message, the brand has drafted an open letter to AI, written by AI, partially.In a front page ad published in 'The New York Times', Fiverrs letter, signed by its CEO Micha Kaufman, calls for coordination between AI and its human overseers. Pointing out the potential, and power of this tech innovation, the addressal underpins the need for human finesse in making the work produced by AI less 'robotic'.Interestingly, Kaufman chose to employ AI to write the letter, perhaps, to exemplify how it is still fairly incomplete without human supervision. However, the letter lauds the productivity mustered by coupling the potential of AI with human creativity. For this reason, as the letter reads, the platform has decided to add AI categories, such asMidjourney, ChatGPT and Dall-E, to its catalog of services, in a bid to accommodate artists and programmers, who have already embraced these advanced tools in their workflow.The discussion surrounding AI's rapid growth, and its widely pursued idea of 'free will', has often lead to heated debates as to what implications this new tech could have on human lives. For instance, with the likes of ChatGPT and Dall-E gaining immense popularity, many fear that artists and programmers from across the world have found themselves an almost mythical competitor. Fiverr, in the letter, pegs AI, despite its formidable potential, beneath human creativity, calling the works produced by it 'robotic' and devoid of personality. The ad campaign, while primarily being an introduction to new AI tools on Fiverr, also provides a more composed perspective on how to welcome AI. According to Fiverr, searches for AI-related services on the platform have increased over 1,400% in the last six months.The addition of the AI-services will be complemented by Fiverrs in-house AI tools, such as Fiverr Logo Maker for designers and AI Auditions for voice-over artists.",

      "body": "ChatGPT\nsaid Tuesday they created a second tool to help distinguish between text written by a human and that written by its own AI platform and other, similar technology.\nThe new tool from San Francisco-based OpenAI could help teachers and professors detect when students use ChatGPT to cheat or plagiarize. Some of the largest school districts in the country have banned the technology, concerned students will use it as a shortcut for essays or other writing assignments and exams.\nThey also worry that the content it generates can bypass software that detects when students use information that's not their own work.\nChatGPT works like this: Simply ask the chatbot a question on any topic and get a speedy, detailed response in paragraph form. (GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.) Sometimes its answers can be wrong, biased or out-of-date.\nHow does the new tool work?\nPrassidh Chakraborty, a spokesperson for OpenAI, said the company wants to help students and educators benefit from its platform and doesn't want its chatbot \"to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else.\"\nThe longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text  a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man  and the tool will label it as either very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated.\n'This shouldn't be a surprise':\nThe education community shares mixed reactions to ChatGPT\nThe company created the tool \"to help mitigate false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human,\" he said.\nThe company on its blog post Tuesday warned users that the tool isn't fully reliable, and creators want feedback.\n\"It still has a number of limitations,\" Chakraborty said. \"So it should be used as a complement to other methods of determining the source of text instead of being the primary decision-making tool.\"\nStory continues\nMore:",

On Monday, Jan. 23, 2023, Microsoft announced that it is making a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the San Francisco artificial intelligence lab behind the experimental online chatbot ChatGPT.\nWASHINGTON -- The alien invasion has begun.\nSome experts say that when artificial intelligence takes off, it's going to be like Martians landing on the National Mall.\nSo far, our mind children, as the roboticist Hans Moravec called our artificially intelligent offspring, are in the toddler phase. They're headed for the rebellious teenage phase. When AI hurtles into adulthood and isn't so artificial anymore, we'll be relegated to being the family pets, as a resigned Steve Wozniak put it.\nSilicon Valley is reeling at the prowess of an experimental chatbot called ChatGPT, released by OpenAI in late November and deemed \"scary good\" by Elon Musk. Musk, one of the founders with Sam Altman, left and now Microsoft is a partner.\nThere's keening that ChatGPT -- couldn't they have come up with a better name, like HAL? -- will eliminate millions of jobs.\nAlready a subscriber?

      "body": "Article\nShare\n___Cheaters beware: ChatGPT maker releases AI detection toolSAN FRANCISCO (AP)  The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework. The new AI Text Classifier launched by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPTs ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning. OpenAI cautions that its new tool is not foolproof and the method for detecting AI-written text is imperfect and can be wrong at times.___Difficulty measuring methane slows plan to slash emissionsNEW YORK (AP)  Satellites, drones and airplanes equipped with infrared cameras will likely be the backbone of a new federal policy to fine the nations largest methane polluters. But the nascent industry has a long way to go before it can accurately measure just how much methane polluters are releasing. And the nations new methane reduction program, which was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, will allow the government to fine those polluters for methane emissions based on measurements taken in 2024. That leaves little time to get a reliable system in place.___US wage growth slowed in the final quarter of 2022WASHINGTON (AP)  Pay and benefits for Americas workers grew at a healthy but more gradual pace in the final three months of 2022, the third straight slowdown that could help reassure the Federal Reserve that wage gains wont fuel higher inflation. Wages and benefits, such as health insurance, grew 1% in the October-December quarter compared with the previous three months. That marked a solid gain, though it was slower than the 1.2% increase in the July-September quarter.___Boeing bids farewell to an icon, delivers last 747 jumbo jetSEATTLE (AP)  Boeing bids farewell to an icon on Tuesday: Its delivering its final 747 jumbo jet. Since it debuted in 1969, the 747 has served as a cargo plane, a commercial aircraft capable of carrying nearly 500 passengers, and the Air Force One presidential aircraft. It revolutionized international travel. But over about the past 15 years, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have introduced more profitable and fuel efficient wide-body planes, with two engines instead of the 747s four. The final plane is the 1,574th built by Boeing in the Puget Sound region of Washington state. Its being delivered to cargo carrier Atlas Air.___Unprecedented profit for Exxon as travel, and war, heated upNEW YORK (AP)  Exxon Mobil posted record annual profits in 2022 as consumers globally struggled with high prices for gasoline, home heating and consumer goods. The energy giant brought in $55.7 billion in annual profits. That exceeded its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008. Exxons bounty came as Americans shelled out $4 per gallon for gasoline in the U.S. during the spring and summer. Oil and natural gas prices surged globally after Russia invaded Ukraine and reduced its supply of energy to Europe. The record profits were a marked turnaround from two years ago, when the coronavirus pandemic hit and travel ground to a halt, killing demand for fuels.___Adult Happy Meals, McRib, feed McDonalds sales in Q4CHICAGO (AP)  Adult Happy Meals and other limited-time promotions boosted traffic at McDonalds restaurants during the fourth quarter despite higher prices. The company said Tuesday that global same-store sales __ or sales at stores open at least a year __ rose 12.6% in the October-December period. That beat Wall Streets expectations. U.S. sales soared in October after McDonalds launched adult Happy Meals featuring limited-edition toys designed by the streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market. But McDonalds warned that higher prices for food, labor and energy will weigh on its operating margins this year, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.___Wall Street climbs to add more to its strong JanuaryNEW YORK (AP)  Wall Street closed out a strong January with more gains. The S&P 500 rose 1.5% Tuesday, marking its third winning month in the last four. The Dow rose 1.1% and the Nasdaq rose 1.7%. The gains came ahead of what many investors hope will be one of the Federal Reserves last hikes to interest rates for a while. Markets got a boost after a report showed that growth for workers pay and benefits slowed during the end of 2022. While thats frustrating for people trying to keep up with soaring prices, markets see it as an encouraging sign of easing pressure on inflation.___Lawmakers aim to raise penalties for US airline disruptionsWASHINGTON (AP)  Congress is going to take another look at legislation covering the rights of airline passengers. Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Tuesday they re-introduced bills to increase penalties when airlines strand or delay passengers, and to limit airline fees. Both ideas have failed in previous years, but the senators say theyve got a good chance of success this time because of outrage over debacles like the one at Southwest Airlines in December. But theyll face obstacles. Republicans havent supported the measures yet. And airlines have succeeded before in lobbying Congress against proposals to limit or regulate the fees that they charge customers for services like checking baggage.___Alaska gold, copper mine blocked over environmental worriesJUNEAU, Alaska (AP)  Federal environmental regulators have blocked a proposed Alaska mine heralded by backers as the most significant undeveloped copper and gold resource globally. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the unusually strong step Tuesday. Its concerned about the mines environmental impact on a rich aquatic ecosystem that supports the worlds largest sockeye salmon fishery. Alaskan Native tribes and environmentalists celebrated Pebble Mines veto. But Pebble Limited Partnership CEO John Shively calls the move unlawful and says a lawsuit is likely. Tribes in the Bristol Bay region in 2010 petitioned the EPA to protect the area under the federal Clean Water Act.___The S&P 500 gained 58.83 points, or 1.5%, to 4,076.60. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 368.95 points, or 1.1, to 34,086.04. The Nasdaq composite tacked on 190.74 points, or 1.7%, to 11,584.55. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 46.22 points, or 2.5%, to 1,931.94.",

      "body": "OpenAI releases tool to detect AI-generated text, including from ChatGPT\nBy Bernice Clark on January 31, 2023\nAfter telegraphing the move in media appearances, OpenAI has launched a tool that attempts to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text  like the text produced by the companys own ChatGPT and GPT-3 models. The classifier isnt particularly accurate  its success rate is around 26%, OpenAI notes  but OpenAI argues that it, when used in tandem with other methods, could be useful in helping prevent AI text generators from being abused.\nThe classifier aims to help mitigate false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human. However, it still has a number of limitations  so it should be used as a complement to other methods of determining the source of text instead of being the primary decision-making tool, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. Were making this initial classifier available to get feedback on whether tools like this are useful, and hope to share improved methods in the future.\nAs the fervor around generative AI  particularly text-generating AI  grows, critics have called on the creators of these tools to take steps to mitigate their potentially harmful effects. Some of the U.S. largest school districts have banned ChatGPT on their networks and devices, fearing the impacts on student learning and the accuracy of the content that the tool produces. And sites including Stack Overflow have banned users from sharing content generated by ChatGPT, saying that the AI makes it too easy for users to flood discussion threads with dubious answers.\nOpenAIs classifier  aptly called OpenAI AI Text Classifier  is intriguing architecturally. It, like ChatGPT, is an AI language model trained on many, many examples of publicly available text from the web. But unlike ChatGPT, its fine-tuned to predict how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI  not just from ChatGPT, but any text-generating AI model.\nMore specifically, OpenAI trained the OpenAI AI Text Classifier on text from 34 text-generating systems from five different organizations, including OpenAI itself. This text was paired with similar (but not exactly similar) human-written text from Wikipedia, websites extracted from links shared on Reddit and a set of human demonstrations collected for a previous OpenAI text-generating system. (OpenAI admits in a support document, however, that it mightve inadvertently misclassified some AI-written text as human-written given the proliferation of AI-generated content on the internet.)\nThe OpenAI Text Classifier wont work on just any text, importantly. It needs a minimum of 1,000 characters, or about 150 to 250 words. It doesnt detect plagiarism  an especially unfortunate limitation considering that text-generating AI has been shown to regurgitate the text on which it was trained. And OpenAI says that its more likely to get things wrong on text written by children or in a language other than English, owing to its English-forward data set.\nThe detector hedges its answer a bit when evaluating whether a given piece of text is AI-generated. Depending on its confidence level, itll label text as very unlikely AI-generated (less than a 10% chance), unlikely AI-generated (between a 10% and 45% chance), unclear if it is AI-generated (a 45% to 90% chance), possibly AI-generated (a 90% to 98% chance)  or likely AI-generated (an over 98% chance).\nOut of curiosity, I fed some text through the classifier to see how it might manage. While it confidently, correctly predicted that several paragraphs from a TechCrunch article about Metas Horizon Worlds and a snippet from an OpenAI support page werent AI generated, the classifier had a tougher time with article-length text from ChatGPT, ultimately failing to classify it altogether. It did, however, successfully spot ChatGPT output from a Gizmodo piece about  what else?  ChatGPT.\nAccording to OpenAI, the classifier incorrectly labels human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time. That mistake didnt happen in my testing, but I chalk that up to the small sample size.\nImage Credits: OpenAI\nOn a practical level, I found the classifier not particularly useful for evaluating shorter pieces of writing. 1,000 characters is a difficult threshold to reach in the realm of messages, for example emails (at least the ones I get on a regular basis). And the limitations give pause  OpenAI emphasizes that the classifier can be evaded by modifying some words or clauses in generated text.\nThats not to suggest the classifier is useless  far from it. But it certainly wont stop committed fraudsters (or students, for that matter) in its current state.\nThe question is, will other tools? Something of a cottage industry has sprung up to meet the demand for AI-generated text detectors. ChatZero, developed by a Princeton University student, uses criteria including perplexity (the complexity of text) and burstiness (the variations of sentences) to detect whether text might be AI-written. Plagiarism detector Turnitin is developing its own AI-generated text detector. Beyond those, a Google search yields a least a half-dozen other apps that claim to be able to separate the AI-generated wheat from the human-generated chaff, to torture the metaphor.\nItll likely become a cat-and-mouse game. As text-generating AI improves, so will the detectors  a never-ending back-and-forth similar to that between cybercriminals and security researchers. And as OpenAI writes, while the classifiers might help in certain circumstances, theyll never be a reliable sole piece of evidence in deciding whether text was AI-generated.\nThats all to say that theres no silver bullet to solve the problems AI-generated text poses. Quite likely, there never will be.\nsource: TechCrunch",

      "body": "OpenAI, the creators of\nChatGPT\n, have clearly heard the critiques about its AI chatbot. Namely, those from educators who have voiced concern regarding students using ChatGPT to do their homework or write their papers for them.\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI\nreleased\n(Opens in a new window)\na new AI classifier tool aimed at directly addressing those concerns. The free web tool was created by OpenAI in order to help users determine whether a block of text was written by a human or a computer.\nThe tool is simple to use. Simply visit the AI classifier\n(Opens in a new window)\n, log in, and copy and paste the block of text you want to check. The classifier will then rank the text on a scale as either likely to be AI-generated, possibly, unclear, unlikely, or very unlikely.\nCopy-paste some text, and find out if a human wrote it.\nCredit: OpenAI / Screengrab\nWhile this sounds incredibly helpful in tackling some concerns about AI written text, OpenAI does make it very clear that there are caveats. For example, according to OpenAI, \"the classifier is not fully reliable.\"\n\"In our evaluations on a 'challenge set' of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as 'likely AI-written,' while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives),\" said the company in a\nblog post\n(Opens in a new window)\n.\n3 things to know before talking to ChatGPT about your mental health\nThere are other limitations with the classifier addressed by OpenAI in its announcement. For example, the classifier works considerably worse with text that is less than 1,000 words. Sometimes it can falsely identify human-written content as text created by a computer. And it only really works well with English-language text.\nOpenAI isn't the first to release a tool to help detect when text is computer-generated. In fact, its not the first classifier tool the company itself has released. However, it's \"significantly more reliable\" than its previous tool, according to OpenAI. And its very notable that such a tool is continuously being worked on by one of the leaders in the AI space as well.\nStill, there's quite a way to go before teachers and educators can confidently rely on any AI-detection tool to suss out cheating in the classroom.\nMore in",

An extra arrow to your bow if you want.\"\nFrom McLaren's perspective, the value was clear. AsEd Green, head of commercial technology at McLaren Racing, explains: \"It was anabsolute game changer.\n\"I thinkit waspretty instrumental in getting the number of wins we did, leading up to the championship.\"\nAs the Splunk systembecame a core part ofthe Esports team,itopened up avenues for some experiments in trying new things, which would not be possible in the environment of a normal grand prix weekend.\nJames Hodge, GVP & Chief Strategy Advisor, Splunk,said: \"There's more you can do withEsports, in termsofrapid development.\n\"The stakesarevery different.If you touch anything in real F1, you are touching an almost mission critical system. If an F1 car isn't receiving telemetry back into the McLaren garage, they can't turn the engine on.\n\"On theEsportsside, it is less of an implication: if you don't get the telemetry and that doesn't work,you know Lucas can still go and drive.\n\"Plus there's less complexity.You're not moving an IT rig around 20-something different locations around the world.\n\"So it allows you to trytorapid prototype things. We've been able to try things on the gaming side that we might have taken a year to get into production on the real side, just because you've got a big team that needs to change the way of working to adapt to that new dashboard analytics.\"\n\nLucas Blakeley, McLaren Shadow Esports team\n\nGreen adds: \"What Splunk is allowing us to do is kind of iterate really, really fast, without needing a roomful of super expertise.\n\"AndI think the speed at which we're developing with Splunk, some of that is feeding back into the F1team.\n\"They're seeing a little bit of what we're doingandgoing, 'okay, that's pretty quick.'\"\nThe ability to experiment so much on the Esports side, with car performance parameters so similar to the real world, has inevitably opened the door to seewhat role AI can have in strategy calls.\nGreen cites the AlphaGo computer programme, developed by Google subsidiary DeepMind, that was able to beat a human at the game Go,as an example of where the right kind of AI can outsmart the human brain.\n\"It's interestingwhat happened in Go,\" he said. \"How far can we push things like that in to sport?\n\"It could provide some real inspirationand, on a personal level, I think I'd love to see an AI-led strategy one day.\"\nFor now, Splunkthinks that the technology is only at the stage where it can offer help in the decision-making process, rather than making the final call itself.\n\"What we're doing is looking at what is the probability someone's going to pit based on their performance,\"added Hodge.\n\"You can start to see maybe a degradation in lap times,sothis is probably going to be their pit window.\n\"And that's where we're at: we're not quite in the 'run me a race and predict everything from it.' But we are definitely helping withthedecision-tree making.\"\nGreenagrees that letting AI run the showis something that isnotrealisticright now.\n\"Are we there today? No.Do I think we'd ever have AI making the decision of when we get in the pit?Well, there are times when you can see it's time to stop, asthere's that dotted yellow line[on the race trace]that shows us the pit window.\n\"But there's so many parameters.

WEIRD outfit amalgamations shoe-horned under production descriptions. Wardobe in a box companies that depend far too much on spreadsheets instead of the human eye.\nIt all sticks out. Badly. Its the style-equivalent of calling customer service, and instead of getting a real person, you get stuck in phone-tree hell. All because some over-paid executive whos never answered (let alone made) a call to customer service thought this automated way would be more efficient.\nThis is an actual screenshot from when I recently looked at some J. Crew cords.\nLove ya J. Crew, but whatever youre paying for your how to wear it software, its too much.\nIts a waste of everyones time and resources. And now ChatGPT wants to write the next great American novel, by ripping off all the previous great American novels.\nThose who are spending\nmillions\nbillions of dollars trying to make human-creativity-replicating artificial intelligence fail to understand something very important. Efficiency and efficacy are not always one and the same. Or to put it another way\nits both easier and BETTER for us, if we humans just did the creative, communicative work.\nTheyre called intangibles for a reason.\nSorry Im late, I was writing my algorithm that would automate our military tactics.\nWhen did we become so allergic to verbs? When did do the things become some radical concept?\nIm not arguing that automation cant be innovation. Of course it can be (see abacus > calculator). The persistent desire by true innovators to build a better mouse trap has driven much of our species progress.\nBut at some point it goes too far, and the obsessive pursuit of efficiency through automation (*greed*) becomes an excuse to not get things done.\nWhat the cult of the hyper efficient cant grasp, is that by the time most of them are done obsessively building their rodent-trapping Rube Goldberg machine, all of the mice have already been caught by those willing to get their hands dirty. And worse yet, their damned cluster-mess of a contraption hasnt caught a single mouse. Instead, all it keeps doing is collecting underpants.\nLess shake weights. More pushups. Especially when inventing shake weights is being used as a way to avoid pushups.\nBut I wrote this music software and it can auto-magically write a crappy pop song!\n(*\n*) BAD. NO. Do not want.\nWhy not?\nYou need to write the crappy pop song. Because if you dont, youll never learn to write a better pop song. And if you dont write those better pop songs, what the hell is ChatGPT gonna rip off in 2056?? All kidding aside, if we become dependent on AI for producing creative and communicative works, at some point well run so low on original material that the copies of the copies will become nothing but noise. Society will become one big music festival of cover bands.\nWhats the big deal? Youre freaking out about robots eventually taking your order at the drive-thru.\nFFS. Dont you know how many success stories started at the drive-thru?? THATS THE POINT.\nGood leads to great\n. Even if the great you end up with isnt what you were foreseeing.\nIt may be silly. It may take time. But until if/when the singularity happens (and robots harvest our faces), us knuckleheads here at this tiny (well dressed?) internet-lemonade-stand will:\nkeep looking at stuff\nconsider the price charged to acquire said stuff\nwe will then subsequently use our brains (",

I read it expecting high-quality ideas but got a list that included things like dating help, dealing with loneliness and anxiety, and crime fighting.\nIf Im harsh with ChatGPT posts like that one is because they mix drops of truth with rivers of wild exaggerations and plain falsehoods just to amass popularity (or, worse, because they believe their claims).\nToday, I wont criticize ChatGPT but offer solutions. This is my version of what that blog post should have been. Im going to combat misinformation by pointing to applications for which ChatGPT, flawed as it is, works\nvery well\nnot more or less like other tools, but arguably better than anything else out there.\nThere are things not even magic can do\nThis article is in line with my\nat defining reasonable boundaries for language models (LMs) use. No one has told us how they work or for which tasks theyre well-suited (they dont know), so our only option is try-and-error. However, people are very bad at making\ncorrect\nMore so if were dealing with\nmagic.\nIf I found a magic wand, I wouldnt be able to tell where its limits lie and would presuppose its capable of doing a lot of things it may not be able toinfluenced by Harry Potter-like fantasy pop culture. Thats ChatGPT in the minds of most people. A magic wand. A piece of advanced alien tech. Something right out of sci-fi Hollywood.\nBut\neverything\nhas limits (actually, if we get philosophical, things can only be defined through their limits). ChatGPT is no different.\nIt cant do everything but can do\nsome\nthings. And like any other tool, it does some tasks better than others. If we accept these two premises, it follows that there must be a task (or set of tasks) in the applicability space that is the perfect target for ChatGPT (its suitability is optimal). And, in the case of the bestor among the besttools in a given category (which I believe is true for ChatGPT), itd be the undisputed best option for doing such tasks.\nThats the set of tasks for which ChatGPT is both perfectly-suited and the best option available. Thats what were looking for.\nThis is obvious for tools designed with a purpose (e.g. a calculator is great for arithmetic and its better than an abacus), but its tricky for things like web3a solution in search of a problem. I dont think ChatGPT belongs to the latter class, but it isnt straightforward to correctly pinpoint its utility.\nFinding those ChatGPT-ideal tasks is a matter of knowing where to look. The chatbots unique characteristics reveal hints to discover them. For instance, ChatGPT has a component of stochasticity, which means its unpredictable and unreliable. Thats bad if were doing a math problem but may be great if were writing the lyrics of a new song. Unpredictability goes well with creativity.\nInstead of assuming ChatGPT is great for anything related to text, writing, or language, we should approach the problem of its applicability with that top-down perspective: Lets understand the characteristics that best define the chatbot, and from there draw a line to those tasks where those traits arent bugs but features.\nFrom there, its our responsibility to avoid the temptation to use ChatGPT for anything else just because other people are doing so.\nThis article is a compilation of five ChatGPT-ideal tasks that Ive come up with following this procedure. Theyre practical, concrete applications where ChatGPT not only works fine but\nstands out\nabove other options.\nThe Algorithmic Bridge is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\nSubscribe\n1. Combining ideas like no human can\nIf theres something that ChatGPT does amazinglyand significantly better than humansis combining disparate ideas seamlessly into a homogenous whole. Im talking about things like this:\nRetweets\nThis is arguably ChatGPTs most outstanding skill. Its not just a good tool for this, but simply the only one that can do it (together with other LMs). Not even humansincluding those who are experts in the prompted concepts (e.g. bubble sort algorithms\nand\ngangster movies)could do this with ease.\nChatGPT was trained on tons of text data so its expected itd know about a vast array of topicstheyre represented somehow across its billions of parameters. To some degree, our brain works similarly. Memory recall isnt that different from using prompts to make an LM output something specific (note that Im not drawing a parallelism in structure or even function but in principle).\nHowever, mixing any two or three topics seamlessly isnt something the human brain can do by default. Theres an alienness to ChatGPTs ability (\nas there is alienness in the way it makes errors\n). The way it combines people's writing styles, disparate themes, or ideas that have never been put together to create a unique piece with semantic cohesiveness is impressive. This embodies, for me, the creative idiosyncrasy of LMs. In contrast, humanseven the most skillfulwould find it\nextremely\nhard\nto create such concoctions consistently. Our brain isnt well-suited for this task whereas ChatGPT is.\nThis phenomenon is the result of how concepts are represented in ChatGPTs latent space. Prompts allow us to access it in a way human memory is inaccessible (at least at willwho knows what we could get from a persons mind if we could prompt it as we do with ChatGPT).\n2. Modifying content youve created\nHumans are great at exploring ideas\nin depth\nwhich is something ChatGPT struggles with. Thats why Id never recommend it to write essays like this one, and either emails, tweets, or a book.\nYet Id be willing to use it to\ntranslate\nbetween those formats. Within routine administrative-ish work, I find this ChatGPTs sole strength.\nIts great with the form of language but horrible with coherence (not to mention its outputs arent innovative or engaging). Its useful for editing things that already exist but quite bad at creating new ones that require a minimum degree of association with reality.\nWhen I say translate between formats the first image that comes to mind is something like this, which I think its high in usefulness and safety:\nRetweets\nIf we extrapolate this idea to everything else, we find that ChatGPT is well-equipped to summarize articles in bullet points (I recommend doing this with those youve written), rewrite paragraphs Grammarly-style (but not write them from scratch), or customize content across platforms (e.g. take a Substack article and make it a LinkedIn post and then a Twitter thread).\nThe key here is\nperfect information\n. When youve written or created something, you know everything theres to know about it. ChatGPT modifying the content in some way is inoffensive because as soon as an idea or concept doesnt match your original intention, youll catch it. This also works well when youre an expert on the topic (although in this case if you catch an error ",

      "body": "Published Jan 31st, 2023 4:46PM EST\nImage: OpenAI\nThe creators of ChatGPT are launching a new tool to catch people using ChatGPT.\nToday, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and DALLE 2, announced a new AI classifier tool to detect if a human being has written textor artificial intelligence. The company hopes the new tool can be used to prevent the misuse of AI text-generation tools for devious purposes such as automated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty, and positioning an AI chatbot as ahuman.\nWeve trained a classifier to distinguish between text written by a human and text written by AIs from a variety of providers. While it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text, we believe good classifiers can inform mitigations for false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human: for example, runningautomated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty, and positioning an AI chatbot as ahuman.\nWhile that might panic all of the high schoolers who are now using ChatGPT to pass their history test (or\nlaw or business school attendees\n), the company says that the reliability of the tool is not great so far. According to their testing, the classifier was only able to identify about 26% of AI content as being written by a non-human.\nOur classifier is not fully reliable.In our evaluations on a challenge set of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text(true positives) as likely AI-written, while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time(false positives). Our classifiers reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases. Compared to ourpreviously released classifier, this new classifier is significantly more reliable on text from more recent AIsystems.\nOpenAI announced that it is making the classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful. The company also mentioned that it is engaging with educators for input and developing new resources around the use of AI and education.\nAnyone who is interested in trying out the classifier can check it out on OpenAIs website.\nThis article talks about:",

Short for ChatGenerative Pre-trained Transformer, ChatGPT is an AI program that writes extensive responses to various types of complex problems.\nWhile launched only a few months ago out of San Francisco, the language model quickly captured national discussion due to just how human-like responses sound in comparison to earlier models of such software -- a South Carolina professor recently caught a student using it to write a 500-word essay on the 18th century philosopher David Hume.\nThis Is What ChatGPT Can Do For Real Estate\nIn the world of real estate, ChatGPT is also causing waves for its ability to write certain types of content. In a videohe posted to Twitter, Iowa Realtor JJ Johannes explains how he uses the program to write descriptions for the homes he sells.\n\"I put in a prompt to ChatGPT to ask it to write a listing description on a property based on a feature and you can see what it has put together here,\" Johannes says in front of a background listing for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Cedar Rapids. \"Now I can ask it to regenerate it, I could add more features.\"\nPhrases like \"ample space for relaxation\" are no different from many of the human-written descriptions found online -- and so, many agents have enthusiastically embraced using the free platform to shorten this part of their job.\n\"I fine-tune all kinds of drafts with ChatGPT,\" Andres Asion,another local broker with Miami Real Estate Group, told CNN. \"Sometimes I'll tell tell it to make it shorter or funnier, and it gives you so many samples to pick and edit from.\"\nIs ChatGPT Going To Be The End Of Everything?\nJohannes' video has also caught a fair bit of flak from agents skeptical on the software's capabilities as well as the potential hazards of using it for too much.\n\"Just teach it to describe cramped shacks as 'cozy' and heaps of rotting lumber as 'fixer uppers' and you're good to go,\" one user wrote sarcastically underneath the post only to be hit with retorts about this was already a core criticism of human-written descriptions.\nThe discussion fizzled out into the habitual push-and-pull between those who trust technology and artificial intelligence's ability to simplify certain tasks and those who fear its impact on human jobs and interactions. But at least for now, real estate seems to be embracing the software far more enthusiastically than fields like academia and finance.\nZillow spokespersonMatt Kreamer told CNN that the real estate platform is \"notpromoting or wary of ChatGPT but are interested in how its being used and watching it.\"\nBy",

      "body": "public release of ChatGPT\n, an AI chatbot that can help students and professionals generate shockingly convincing essays, the company is unveiling a new tool to help teachers adapt.\nOpenAI on Tuesday announced a new feature, called an AI text classifier, that allows users to check if an essay was written by a human or AI. But even OpenAI admits its imperfect.\nThe tool, which works on English AI-generated text, is powered by a machine learning system that takes an input and assigns it to several categories. In this case, after pasting a body of text such as a school essay into the new tool, it will give one of five possible outcomes, ranging from likely generated by AI to very unlikely.\nLama Ahmad, policy research director at OpenAI, told CNN that educators have been asking for a ChatGPT feature like this, but warns it should be taken with a grain of salt.\nWe really dont recommend taking this tool in isolation because we know that it can be wrong and will be wrong at times  much like using AI for any kind of assessment purposes, Ahmad said. We are emphasizing how important it is to keep a human in the loop  and that its just one data point among many others.\nAhmad notes that some teachers have referenced past examples of student work and writing style to gauge whether it was written by the student. While the new tool might provide another reference point, Ahmad said teachers need to be really careful in how they include it in academic dishonesty decisions.\nSince it was made available in late November, ChatGPT has been used to\nrethink their assignments\nin response to ChatGPT, even as it remains unclear how widespread use is of the tool among students and how harmful it could really be to learning.\nOpenAI now joins a small but growing list of efforts to help educators detect when a written work is generated by ChatGPT. Some companies such as Turnitin are actively working on ChatGPT plagiarism detection tools that could help teachers identify when assignments are written by the tool. Meanwhile, Princeton student Edward Tuan told CNN more than 95,000 people have already tried the beta version of his own ChatGPT detection feature, called ZeroGPT, noting there has been incredible demand among teachers so far.\nJan Leike  a lead on the OpenAI alignment team, which works to make sure the AI tool is aligned with human values  listed several reasons for why detecting plagiarism via ChatGPT may be a challenge. People can edit text to avoid being identified by the tool, for example. It will also be best at identifying text that is very similar to the kind of text that weve trained it on.\nIn addition, the company said its impossible to determine if predictable text  such as a list of the first 1,000 prime numbers  was written by AI or a human because the correct answer is always the same, according to a company blog post. The classifier is also very unreliable on short texts below 1,000 characters.\nDuring a demo with CNN ahead of Tuesdays launch, ChatGPT successfully labeled several bodies of work. An excerpt from the book Peter Pan, for example, was deemed unlikely to be AI generated. In the company blog post, however, OpenAI said it incorrectly labeled human-written text as AI-written 5% of the time.\nDespite the possibility of false positives, Leike said the company aims to use the tool to spark conversations around AI literacy and possibly deter people from claiming that AI-written text was created by a human. He said the decision to release the new feature also stems from the debate around whether humans have a right to know if theyre interacting with AI.\nThis question is much bigger than what we are doing here; society as a whole has to grapple with that question, he said.\nOpenAI said it encourages the general public to share their feedback on the AI check feature. Ahmad said the company continues to talk with K-12 educators and those at the collegiate level and beyond, such as Harvard University and the Stanford Design School.\nThe company sees its role as an educator to the educators, according to Ahmad, in the sense that OpenAI wants to make them more aware about the technologies and what they can be used for and what they should not be used for.\nWere not educators ourselves  were very aware of that  and so our goals are really to help equip teachers to deploy these models effectively in and out of the classroom, Ahmad said. That means giving them the language to speak about it, help them understand the capabilities and the limitations, and then secondarily through them, equip students to navigate the complexities that AI is already introducing in the world.\nJoin our Newsletter for the latest news right to your inbox\nEmail address",

      "description": "So I now introduce you to ChatGPT and OpenAI.",
      "body": "Every few years, something really new comes along, sneaking into our vocabularies and our way of interacting with money. Then suddenly, it reaches a tipping point and becomes ubiquitous. I like to keep an eye out for those life-changing opportunities, which mostly revolve around technology. Change is inevitable, and its up to us to make the choice of whether to embrace it or try to ignore it. For example, today almost everyones texting, although some of us would rather hear from our children and grandchildren on the phone. And weve all learned how to use FaceTime and Zoom, and how to stream movies on Netflix. You dont dial 411 for information; you search on Google. It is the brain of the universe. Technology has revolutionized personal finances from online bill payment to online trading. A personal money tracking and budget program like Quicken was shocking at first on your computer. Now its on your phone through Mint. It was once astounding to extract cash from a machine that was not even inside a bank. I remember. I did stories on all of those events that are now part of our everyday life. So, with that as a precedent, I now introduce you to ChatGPT and OpenAI. Just drop those buzzwords at dinner tonight! AI stands for artificial intelligence. Yes, it conjures up sci-fi movies about robots taking over the world. And we are definitely getting closer. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (google it), artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making and translation between languages. We already interact with artificial intelligence in our daily lives, likely without recognizing it. Alexa and Siri use artificial intelligence to serve us, as does our Nest thermostat. And AI is there when youve been shopping on Amazon for shoes, move on to a news site for headlines  and suddenly ads for the shoes you were admiring pop up on your screen! Like it or not, AI is deeply in our lives forever. In all the above examples, AI is a tool that we, the user, control. But as in science fiction, AI is moving on, becoming more independent  and able to communicate with us because it has learned so much about our behavior patterns, ways of thinking and has access to all the knowledge in the universe. Its a concept both powerful and scary, but absolutely inevitable. Now comes a company called OpenAI. Heres how they describe themselves: OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. If you want to delve deeper into what they are doing, spend a few minutes watching the video on the home page of OpenAI.com. Im skipping a few steps here, but its time to introduce ChatGPT  a product created by OpenAI. Those initials stand for Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. Its a chatbot that can generate realistic, human-like text. In other words, this allows a bot to have a real, interactive conversation with you, the user! You may never know youre not talking to a human being. Or the conversation can be in writing on your computer screen. The AI bot can recognize languages, accents and idioms  responding intelligently to what you have to say. One early use, for example, is at fast-food drive-thru windows  where it takes your order, repeats it (no onions on that burger!) and then enters it into the restaurant order system. And there is even an exchange-traded fund called AI Powered Equity ETF (ticker AIEQ) that so far in 2023 has outperformed the stock market using IBM Corp.s Watson platform to assess more than 6,000 U.S. publicly traded companies each day, scraping regulatory filings, news stories, management profiles, sentiment gauges, financial models, valuations and more to make investing decisions. Some universities no longer offer written essay exams, because a users simple query to the ChatGPT bot could generate an entire answer in well-phrased English. Unlike plagiarism, which can be detected by computer programs, this is AI original creation of content. As you might imagine, the possibilities for evil as well as the betterment of society are endless. Forget about fake accounts on Twitter, or disinformation on Facebook. Maybe robotsaregoing to take over the world. Thats the Savage Truth. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

      "body": "January 31, 2023, 4:16 PM ET\nShare\nLanguage is commonly understood to be the stuff of thought. People talk it out and speak their mind, follow trains of thought or streams of consciousness. Some of the pinnacles of human creationmusic, geometry, computer programmingare framed as metaphorical languages. The underlying assumption is that the brain processes the world and our experience of it through a progression of words. And this supposed link between language and thinking is a large part of what makes ChatGPT and similar programs so uncanny: The ability of AI to answer any prompt with human-sounding language can suggest that the machine has some sort of intent, even sentience.\nBut then the program says something\ncompletely absurd\nthat there are 12 letters in nineteen or that sailfish are mammalsand the veil drops. Although ChatGPT can generate fluent and sometimes elegant prose, easily passing the Turing-test benchmark that has haunted the field of AI for more than 70 years, it can also seem incredibly dumb, even dangerous. It gets math wrong, fails to give the most basic cooking instructions, and displays shocking biases. In a new paper, cognitive scientists and linguists address this dissonance by separating communication via language from the act of thinking: Capacity for one does not imply the other. At a moment when pundits are fixated on the potential for generative AI to disrupt every aspect of how we live and work, their argument should force a reevaluation of the limits and complexities of artificial and human intelligence alike.\nThe researchers explain that words may not work very well as a synecdoche for thought. People, after all, identify themselves on a continuum of visual to verbal thinking; the experience of not being able to put an idea into words is perhaps as human as language itself. Contemporary research on the human brain, too, suggests that there is a separation between language and thought, says Anna Ivanova, a cognitive neuroscientist at MIT and one of the studys two lead authors. Brain scans of people using dozens of languages have revealed a particular network of neurons that fires independent of the language being used (including invented tongues such as Navi and Dothraki).\nThat network of neurons is not generally involved in thinking activities including math, music, and coding. In addition, many patients with aphasiaa loss of the ability to comprehend or produce language, as a result of brain damageremain skilled at arithmetic and other nonlinguistic mental tasks. Combined, these two bodies of evidence suggest that language alone is not the medium of thought; it is more like a messenger. The use of grammar and a lexicon to communicate functions that involve other parts of the brain, such as socializing and logic, is what makes human language special.\nRead: Hollywoods love affair with fictional languages\nChatGPT and software like it demonstrate an incredible ability to string words together, but they struggle with other tasks. Ask for a letter explaining to a child that Santa Claus is fake, and it produces a moving message signed by Saint Nick himself. These large language models, also called LLMs, work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on everything before it (popular belief follows contrary to, for example). But ask ChatGPT to do basic arithmetic and spelling or give advice for frying an egg, and you may receive grammatically superb\nnonsense\n: If you use too much force when flipping the egg, the eggshell can crack and break.\nThese shortcomings point to a distinction, not dissimilar to one that exists in the human brain, between piecing together words and piecing together ideaswhat the authors term formal and functional linguistic competence, respectively. Language models are really good at producing fluent, grammatical language, says the University of Texas at Austin linguist Kyle Mahowald, the papers other lead author. But that doesnt necessarily mean something which can produce grammatical language is able to do math or logical reasoning, or think, or navigate social contexts.\nIf the human brains language network is not responsible for math, music, or programmingthat is, for thinkingthen theres no reason an artificial neural network trained on terabytes of text would be good at those things either. In line with evidence from cognitive neuroscience, the authors write, LLMs behavior highlights the difference between being good at language and being good at thought. ChatGPTs ability to get mediocre scores on some business- and law-school exams, then, is more a mirage than a sign of understanding.\nStill, hype swirls around the next iteration of language models, which will train on far more words and with far more computing power. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, claims that its programs are approaching a so-called general intelligence that would put the machines on par with humankind. But if the comparison to the human brain holds, then simply making models better at word prediction wont bring them much closer to this goal. In other words, you can dismiss the notion that AI programs such as ChatGPT have a soul or resemble an\nalien invasion.\nIvanova and Mahowald believe that different training methods are required to spur further advances in AIfor instance, approaches specific to logical or social reasoning rather than word prediction. ChatGPT may have already taken a step in that direction, not just reading massive amounts of text but also incorporating\nhuman feedback\n: Supervisors were able to comment on what constituted good or bad responses. But with few details about ChatGPTs training available, its unclear just what that human input targeted; the program apparently thinks 1,000 is both greater and less than 1,062. (OpenAI released an update to ChatGPT yesterday that supposedly improves its mathematical capabilities, but its still reportedly struggling with basic word problems.)\nRead: What happens when AI has read everything?\nThere are, it should be noted, people who believe that large language models are not as good at language as Ivanova and Mahowald writethat they are basically glorified auto-completes whose flaws scale with their power. Language is more than just syntax, says Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and prominent AI researcher. In particular, its also about semantics. Its not just that AI chatbots dont understand math or how to fry eggsthey also, he says, struggle to comprehend how a sentence derives meaning from the structure of its parts.\nFor instance, imagine three plastic balls in a row: green, blue, blue. Someone asks you to grab\nthe second blue ball\n: You understand that theyre referring to the last ball in the sequence, but a chatbot might understand the instruction as referring to the second ball, which also happens to be blue. That a large language model is good at language is overstated, Marcus says. But to Ivanova, something like the blue-ball example requires not just compiling wo",

      "description": "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and DALL-E, has released its AI text classifier, a free tool that tries to estimate whether a given piece of text was written by a human or by artificial intelligence.",
      "body": "OpenAI, the company behind DALL-E and ChatGPT, has released a free tool that it says is meant to distinguish between text written by a human and text written by AIs. It warns the classifier is not fully reliable in a press release and should not be used as a primary decision-making tool. According to OpenAI, it can be useful in trying to determine whether someone is trying to pass off generated text as something that was written by a person.\n\nThe tool, known as a classifier, is relatively simple, though you will have to have a free OpenAI account to use it. You just paste text into a box, click a button, and itll tell you whether it thinks the text is very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated. \n\n\"In tests, it identified 26 percent of AI-written textas likely AI-written\"\n\nIn its press release, OpenAI says it trained the model powering the tool using pairs of human-written text and AI-written text on the same topic.\n\nIt does, however, offer quite a few warnings about using the tool. Above the text box, the company notes some limitations:\n\n> Requires a minimum of 1,000 characters, which is approximately 150 - 250 words.\n> The classifier isnt always accurate; it can mislabel both AI-generated and human-written text.\n> AI-generated text can be edited easily to evade the classifier.\n> The classifier is likely to get things wrong on text written by children and on text not in English, because it was primarily trained on English content written by adults.\n\nThe company also says itll sometimes incorrectly but confidently label human-written text as being from an AI, especially if its very different from anything in the training data. It makes it clear that the classifier is still very much a work-in-progress.\n\nThose caveats seem warranted  I ran a few snippets of my own work through the tool, and it marked them all as very unlikely AI-generated. (Fooled em again.) However, it also said it was unclear if this Buzzfeed News article was written by an AI, despite the notice at the bottom that reads, This article was written entirely by ChatGPT. \n\nI also got an unclear result for some articles written by CNET Money, with others getting an unlikely classification. The outlet says these articles were assisted by an AI engine and reviewed, fact-checked and edited by our editorial staff, so there are likely some human tweaks in there (especially since CNET has added corrections to over half of them). While CNETs owner hasnt said which specific system its using for the articles, my co-worker Mia Sato has reported that its used a tool called Wordsmith for some of its content. OpenAI says its tool isnt just for GPT, though, and that it should detect text written by AIs from a variety of providers.\n\nRelated:\nCNET pauses publishing AI-written stories after disclosure controversy, https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/20/23564311/cnet-pausing-ai-articles-bot-red-ventures\n\nI dont mean to imply that OpenAIs classifier doesnt work at all. I ran some examples of ChatGPT responses that people have posted through it, and it marked most of them as possibly or likely AI-generated. OpenAI also says in its tests the tool labeled AI-written text as likely AI-written 26 percent of the time and gave false AI detections 9 percent of the time, outperforming its previous tool for sniffing out AI-detected text.\n\nOpenAI isnt the first to come up with a tool for detecting ChatGPT-generated text; almost immediately after the chatbot went viral, so, too, did sites like GPTZero, which was made by a student named Edward Tian to detect AI plagiarism\n\nOne place OpenAI is really focusing on with this detection tech is education. Its press release says that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, as different schools have reacted to ChatGPT by banning or embracing it. The company says it's engaging with educators in the US to figure out what they see from ChatGPT in their classrooms and is soliciting feedback from anyone involved in education.",

It designs semiconductors that are used in everything from entertainment consoles in cars to cellphones.\nIt also specializes in \"system on a chip\" semiconductors that combine multiple central processors on one logic board to provide artificial intelligence computing.\nAmbarella chips are used in self-driving functions, and the company recently partnered with German auto supplier Continental on an autonomous driving venture.\nMobileye\nTicker: MBLY\nPercent gain: 39%\nMobileye was spun off by Intel and focuses on self-driving technology and driver-assistance systems, including chips and cameras. Volkswagen, Ford, and GM are among its customers. The company has a near-fully autonomous system called SuperVision, and its Chauffeur product is designed to convert a car into a Level 4 self-driven vehicle.\nLast week, the company beat quarterly forecasts and gave an upbeat 2023 revenue projection. CEO Amnon Shashua touted roughly $17 billion worth of bookings that extends through 2030.\n\"We expect SuperVision to be a very large growth driver in 2023 and beyond,\" he told analysts on an earnings call.\nC3.ai\nTicker: AI\nPercent gain: 61%\nC3.ai is an artificial intelligence software suite provider, and has the success of ChatGPT to thank for its recent stock surge. Shares soared roughly 28% on Tuesday alone on news that it would integrate ChatGPT into its product suite.\n\"The C3 Generative AI Product Suite integrates the latest AI capabilities from organizations such as Open AI, Google, and academia, and the most advanced models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 into C3 AI's enterprise AI products,\" C3.ai said in a Tuesday press release.\nAlteryx",

      "body": "31\nSHARES\nOpenAI, the AI research firm behind ChatGPT, has released a new tool to distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated text.\nEven though its impossible to detect AI-written text with 100% accuracy, OpenAI believes its new tool can help to mitigate false claims that humans wrote AI-generated content.\nIn an announcement, OpenAI says its new AI Text Classifier can limit the ability to run automated misinformation campaigns, use AI tools for academic fraud, and impersonate humans with chatbots.\nWhen tested on a set of English texts, the tool could correctly say if the text was written by AI 26% of the time. But it also wrongly thought that human-written text was written by AI 9% of the time.\nOpenAI says its tool works better the longer the text is, which could be why it requires a minimum of 1,000 characters to run a test.\nOther limitations of the new OpenAI Text Classifier include the following:\nCan mislabel both AI-generated and human-written text.\nAI-generated text can evade the classifier with minor edits.\nCan get things wrong with text written by children and on text not in English because it was primarily trained on English content written by adults.\nWith that in mind, lets look at how it performs.\nUsing OpenAIs AI Text Classifier\nThe AI Text Classifier from OpenAI is simple to use.\nLog in, paste the text you want to test, and hit the submit button.\nThe tool will rate the likelihood that AI generated the text you submitted. Results range from the following:\nVery unlikely\nPossibly\nLikely\nI tested it by asking ChatGPT to write an essay about SEO, then submitting the text verbatim to the AI Text Classifier.\nIt rated the ChatGPT-generated essay as possibly generated by AI, which is a strong but uncertain indicator.\nScreenshot from: platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier, January 2023\nThis result illustrates the tools limitations, as it couldnt say with a high degree of certainty that the ChatGPT-generated text was written by AI.\nBy applying minor edits suggested by Grammarly, I reduced the rating from possibly to unclear.\nOpenAI is correct in stating that its easy to evade the classifier. However, its not meant to be the only evidence that AI wrote something.\nIn a FAQ section at the bottom of the page, OpenAI states:\nOur intended use for the AI Text Classifier is to foster conversation about the distinction between human-written and AI-generated content. The results may help, but should not be the sole evidence when deciding whether a document was generated with AI. The model is trained on human-written text from a variety of sources, which may not be representative of all kinds of human-written text.\nOpenAI adds that the tool hasnt been thoroughly tested to detect content containing a combination of AI and human-written text.\nUltimately, the AI Text Classifier can be a valuable resource for flagging potentially AI-generated text, but it shouldnt be used as a definitive measure for making a verdict.\nFeatured Image: IB Photography/Shutterstock",

      "body": "To stop ChatGPT abuse, OpenAI has a new tool that can tell you whether a piece of text is more likely to have come from an AI program or a human.OpenAI introduced the classifier tool on Tuesday to help crack down on AI-generated text thats being passed off as coming from a human. The problem has become especially pronounced in education with students exploiting ChatGPT to complete homework assignments.In a blog post, OpenAI also noted that AI-generated text could pose a threat when used to generate automated text for misinformation campaigns.The classifier tool is pretty straightforward: Submit some text at least 1,000 characters in length, and OpenAI will tell you the likelihood that it came from an AI program or a human. The tool was created by training a computer model to discern between pairs of human-written text and AI-written text on the same topic.<img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/03WPSGVBZZvbzggI35gK5vG-3.png\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"What the classifier tool likes like\"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/03WPSGVBZZvbzggI35gK5vG-3.png\">\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n\nHowever, the San Francisco lab admits the classifier is far from perfect. In our evaluations on a challenge set of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as likely AI-written, while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives), OpenAI wrote.The classifiers reliability also drops when examining short snippets or a few paragraphs of text. So the tool will only work on submissions at over 1,000 characters in length. In addition, sometimes human-written text will be incorrectly but confidently labeled as AI-written by our classifier, OpenAI noted.Additionally, students may quickly learn how to evade detection by modifying some words or clauses in generated content, the lab said.Hence, OpenAI says the tool should not be used as a primary decision-making tool when it comes to determining whether a piece of text is AI-generated or not. But despite all the limitations, OpenAI decided to release the tool as it works on mitigations to prevent students from exploiting ChatGPT for cheating purposes.Were making this classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful, OpenAI added. Our work on the detection of AI-generated text will continue, and we hope to share improved methods in the future.<img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/03WPSGVBZZvbzggI35gK5vG-4.jpg\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"image of ChatGPT\"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/03WPSGVBZZvbzggI35gK5vG-4.jpg\">\n\n\n        \n                            An example of an essay ChatGPT can write. \n            \n                    \n\nLaunched in November, ChatGPT is so advanced that the AI program can write essays, poems, and answer test questions on a wide variety of topics within seconds. While the quality of the responses can be shaky, researchers have found that ChatGPT is smart enough to (barely) pass an MBA exam and even fix numerous bugs in computer code.Inevitably, the emergence of ChatGPT has sparked questions over whether the same program threatens to undermine education and disrupt white-collar jobs. Already, some schools and teachers have decided to block the AI program on their networks over concerns that ChatGPT makes cheating on homework and tests all too easy. Meanwhile, some third parties have released their own free tools to help educators ferret out AI-generated text.OpenAI said its trying to address the cheating problems by reaching out to teachers in the US to learn about their experiences.The lab has also published a document with advice on how educators could introduce and oversee ChatGPT use in their classrooms safely.But OpenAI also noted its still too early to say how programs like ChatGPT will affect education and society. To date we have seen instances of productivity improvements that transform jobs, job displacement, and job creation, but both the near and long term net effects are unclear, it said.",

      "body": "fresh round of funding\nfor the startup. The software giant is also planning to incorporate OpenAI's technology into some of its other products, like the Bing search engine and Office apps, The Information previously reported.\nThe cozy relationship between the two companies may lead to a potential conflict of interest for Microsoft, as it can benefit from OpenAI obtaining more training data, according to Vincent Conitzer, a computer science professor and director of an artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon University.It doesn't mean Microsoft will behave in an irresponsible way, but \"it's always good to be aware of incentives,\" he added.\nThe general concern is that workers can inadvertently share confidential corporate information, like internal software code, with the chatbot to ask for tips or advice on how to improve their work. ChatGPT, in turn, can process the data to train itself, and potentially share versions of the confidential information it received in future exchanges with other users.\n\"Human beings sign NDAs and consequently have incentives to be careful in how they share information. But large language models such as ChatGPT do not have the ability to reason about such issues, at least by default,\" Conitzer told Insider.\nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. OpenAI's representative pointed to ChatGPT's FAQ page for any questions regarding its data and privacy policies.\nAmazon is grappling with the same issue\nIn December, a few weeks after ChatGPT launched publicly, a group of Amazon employees asked in an internal Slack channel whether they could use the chatbot for work. An Amazon corporate lawyer warned the employees not to share \"any Amazon confidential information (including Amazon code you are working on)\" with ChatGPT, as Insider previously reported.\n\"This is important because your inputs may be used as training data for a further iteration of ChatGPT, and we wouldn't want its output to include or resemble our confidential information (and I've already seen instances where its output closely matches existing material),\" the lawyer wrote.\nWho's responsible?\nWhile employees are on the hook for protecting confidential data, it's not clear what exactly Microsoft or OpenAI are doing to address the issue.\n\"All of us together are going to have to figure out what should be expected of everyone in these situations. Is the responsibility on employees to not share sensitive information, or is the responsibility on OpenAI to use information carefully, or some combination?\" Conitzer said. \"As one of the most established leaders in the tech industry, Microsoft is likely to have significant influence on that conversation.\"\nOpenAI's terms of service give the company permission to use all input and output generated by users and ChatGPT. It also says it removes all personally identifiable information (PII) from the data it uses.\nHowever, it's almost impossible for OpenAI to \"thoroughly\" identify and remove personal information from that data, given ChatGPT's rapid growth, Emily Bender, who teaches computational linguistics at University of Washington, previously told Insider. Corporate intellectual property is likely not part of what is defined under PII either, Bender said.\n\"OpenAI is far from transparent about how they use the data, but if it's being folded into training data, I would expect corporations to wonder: After a few months of widespread use of ChatGPT, will it become possible to extract private corporate information with cleverly crafted prompts?\" Bender added.\nGot a tip?",

      "body": "Published Jan 31st, 2023 3:26PM EST\nImage: adrenalinapura / Adobe\nArtificial intelligence has seen a huge surge of popularity in recent months, even years, and with programs like ChatGPT continuing to dominate headlines of the news cycle and other parts of life, A.I. is here to stay. Now, in a shocking experiment, researchers have managed to use A.I. to imitate human evolution, and the results may be even better than reality.\nNow, I should be clear here, we arent talking about A.I. making some insane superhuman or anything. This isnt the plot of a Terminator movie, though scientists have created liquifying robots like the ones seen in some Terminator flicks. Instead, were talking about A.I. imitating human evolution by designing sequences of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins.\nThe researchers were then able to compare those A.I.-created proteins with those made by nature throughout humanitys evolution, and the discovery was pretty staggering. The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology, which outlines how A.I. was able to imitate human evolution.\nA.I. is becoming increasingly more impressive as scientists find new ways to use it to their advantage. Image source: phonlamaiphoto/Adobe\nThey didnt create an entirely new A.I. to pull this off. Instead, they used an already existing language model. The researchers used ProGen, a natural language model created by Salesforce. Thus, the A.I. that imitated human evolution wasnt very different from ChatGPT and other language models, which makes this discovery even more impressive.\nThe researchers began by training ProGen on 280 million proteins. From here, the A.I. was iteratively optimized by learning to predict the probability of the next amino acid given the past amino acids in a raw sequence, the paper explains. Ultimately, the team focused on five specific artificial proteins, which is what helped make it possible for A.I. to imitate human evolution so effectively.\nWhat might be even more impressive is that Salesforce estimates that around 73 percent of the proteins created by ProGen could function, compared to just 59 percent of natural proteins. As such, it appears the A.I. was able to detect evolutionary patterns and even imitate human evolution despite the fact it had not been designed for that kind of work.\nOther A.I., like ChatGPT, have also continued to awe the masses, with Congressmen even using ChatGPT to write legislation. With A.I. so successful, it isnt hard to see why some scientists believe A.I. will destroy mankind.\nThis article talks about:",

On top of that, LaMDA is also fine-tuned to always mold its response on three key parameters  Safety, Quality, and Groundedness.\nThe dialogue-specific training is its main strength and gives LamDA an edge over other language models. Riley Goodside from Scale AI reports that LaMDAs responses are more authentic and closer to human speech than ChatGPT. It will be easier for LaMDA to integrate with applications like Google Assistant, Workspace, and even the search engine itself.\nCapabilities Of ChatGPT\nChatGPT uses the GPT-3.5 architecture. GPT-3.5 has three models  code-DaVinci-002, text-DaVinci-002 and an additional base model to understand codes. The text-DaVinci-002 model has human trainers checking the quality of generated responses.\nGPT 3.5 has reinforcement learning with human feedback or the text-DaVinci-003 model. A reward-based training module lets ChatGPT3 learn from its mistakes and correct its replies if the same question is asked again. ChatGPT and LaMDA are close to the same level. LaMDA is not fine-tuned to generate codes but ChatGPT can generate codes.\nChatGPT is trained for specific tasks. You can use it for language translation, summarisation, text improvement, and more.\nChatGPT is trained over a massively larger dataset than LaMDA.\nMicrosoft will try to integrate OpenAIs ChatGPT with the Bing search engine and make Bing search data available to ChatGPT.",
