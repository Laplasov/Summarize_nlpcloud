      "body": "Share on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nLAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Artificial Intelligence seems to be a topic everyone is talking about and its ability to write just about anything, from a book, to a recipe and even help students with a college essay.\nChatGPT is a cutting-edge AI technology developed by OpenAI which uses deep learning to understand and respond to human language. It can be used in many fields such as chatbots, language translation and automated writing, making it a valuable tool for improving efficiency and communication in day-to-day life.\nThat description you just read about ChatGPT was actually generated by the program. I typed out the question of write me a 15 second news story intro about ChatGPT and why it is an important tool for day-to-day life, and that was the response it came up with.\nChatGPT is easy, accessible and allows you to ask detailed questions. Now, teachers, students and experts are weighing in on how they are using the chatbot.\nThe word rapidly spread to students about the new shiny tool.\nChatGPT in the classroom\nTikTok, said a UNLV student who did not identify himself. Social media. One person started talking about it and the potentials that it had and from there people found out what else you can do and examples of things it has done for them.\nStudents on campuses like at UNLV have constant access to their laptops, smartphones and the internet and now ChatGPT.\nI have used it in my personal classwork already, so I see the potential it has to really become the resource for students, said the UNLV student.\nYou can ask it questions, it can respond, we can modify the questions and it comes off very very real, said associate professor of educational technology at UNLV Kendall Hartley.\nHartley said this free natural language processing program is unlike any other.\nDefinitely was hearing a lot of teachers complaining about students using it, said teacher and research associate with the center for research and assessment at UNLV Rebecca Thomas.\nTeachers like Thomas are now up against the advanced technology.\nPlagiarism detectors that teachers typically use, CCSD actually purchases one for us will not detect these, because they are not plagiarized, because they are unique generated texts, said Thomas.\nChatGPT, I can run the same text through that I know has been produced from online, from ChatGPT, run it in the plagiarism software and it gives you a percentage report, said Hartley. The report for ChatGPT is zero.\nThis leaves educators with no choice but to think outside the box.\nHave your students use chatbot in class and look at what the chatbot wrote and say, Hey look at what the chatbot wrote, is this right? said Thomas. Tell me why or why not.\nCities like Seattle, Los Angeles and New York are banning ChatGPT in some schools.\nYou can limit what you can access from the school device that is usually using the school network, said Hartley.\nThomas said even with banning ChatGPT on school networks and computers students will still find a way.\nIf we can find ways to teach kids hey how is that working is it working, said Thomas. How can we improve it. I think that is a much better way than saying lets just ban technology because we are not and that doesnt serve students who are going to be in this technological world.\nHartley said educators need a software that can detect when a student has used the chatbot, but with technology always evolving it is nearly impossible.\nThere is going to be smart people who are going to be able to come up with tools that will help us be able to determine the probability that this was generated by an AI device and those will improve but anything that tries to run counter to that will improve as well, said Hartley.\nI look forward to finding out what else it can do, said the UNLV student.\nPeople are excited about using ChatGPT for learning. It is often reliable but the danger is that you cannot tell when its wrong unless you already know the answer.\nChatGPT in the workplace\nBoth Hartley and Thomas said through research, they have already seen lawyers, coders, and marketers being replaced and expect this to become more and more common.\nAs of now, ChatGPT is free. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted on Dec. 4: We will have to monetize it somehow at some point; the compute costs are eye-watering.\nwe will have to monetize it somehow at some point; the compute costs are eye-watering\n Sam Altman (@sama)\nThis has proven to be true as the professional plan rolls out, estimating $42 per month.\nCopyright 2023 KVVU.

      "body": "0\nWith the emergence of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has become the hot topic among big tech companies. Google, which has tried to be at the forefront of this segment, sees itself in need of vindicating itself. The CEO of Alphabet, Sundai Pichar, has taken advantage of the presentation of the results of the fourth quarter, somewhat lackluster, to ensure that the company is about to reveal a leap in the searches and other services of the group.\nAlphabet closed the year 2022 with record revenues of 282,836 million dollars (about 259,000 million euros at current exchange rates), 10% more than the previous year, as reported this Thursday. However, operating margins deteriorated and operating income fell 5% to $74.842 billion due to higher costs. Added to this was the loss in value of some investments and other non-operating losses. With all this, net profit fell 21% in the year as a whole, to 59,962 million dollars.\nHS Environment The new climate law is tightening from the current one - HS will show the press conference live at 1.30 pm\nIn the fourth quarter things were even worse. Profit fell 34%, to 13,624 million dollars, after billing grew less than 1%, to 76,048 million, penalized by the strength of the dollar. In addition, advertising revenue from Google and YouTube fell in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2021. The decline is 3.6%, up to 59,042 million. In the history of Google, it is only the second time that advertising billing has decreased and the first, in the second quarter of 2020, was due to the outbreak of the covid pandemic.\nPartly to make up for those lackluster results and partly in response to ChatGPT, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google,\nA vacation trip turns into a tragedy.. A Jordanian judge kills his wife and son\nChatGPT, a Microsoft ally, is perceived as a threat to Google. If it improves and becomes more widespread, users may prefer to ask questions to chat or other similar services instead of trying to find links through the search engine. Alphabet has announced that it will undertake changes to the way it reports results as a result of the rise of artificial intelligence.\nBoth Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat have referred to the cost structure review. Alphabet has announced 12,000 layoffs this year, the equivalent of 6% of the workforce. The figures published this Thursday show that the group created 33,734 jobs in 2022, which has added 71,000 in the last three years. It closed 2022 with 190,234 employees.\nThe Mountain View (California, United States) giant expects to incur employee severance payments and other related charges of $1.9 to $2.3 billion, most of which will be recognized in the accounts for the first quarter of 2023. In addition, it is taking steps to optimize its office space around the world, which will entail terminating and similar costs of approximately $500 million, also in the first quarter of this year.",

When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nRead More.\nGoogle has invested heavily in AI-powered features like Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, and Google Assistant for its Pixel range of phones. Those extensive R&D efforts touch all aspects of its business, like Search, Adsense, chatbots, and even just some fun demos. With Microsoft-backed ChatGPTs sudden rise to fame in the last few months, Google is now on edge, and the industry has been curious to see how it will respond. A new report based on insider information, staff memos, and samples of development work shows the company scrambling to create a ChatGPT equivalent integrated with Search.\nGoogle is working on a two-pronged response to ChatGPTs popularity, CNBC reports. First off, the corporation is internally testing a chatbot called Apprentice Bard. Anonymous staffers say the implementation resembles ChatGPT  the bot provides detailed answers to user prompts and questions. However, instead of using the Microsoft-developed GPT-3.5 code underneath, Bard uses LaMDA, Googles Language Model for Dialogue Application. You might remember that as the same tool that grabbed headlines a few months ago for getting people talking crazy about sentience. The company is reportedly testing this tool, and in recent weeks, Google has asked more employees to lend a hand as the AI improves.\nAt some point, Google plans to enhance Search with Bards association. Images leaked from the companys testing processes show a redesigned interface in the works, incorporating Apprentice Bard responses that attempt to feel like there's an actual person responding to your Search queries.\nOne of the key factors differentiating Bard from ChatGPT is the formers ability to respond based on current data, staying up-to-date with news and trends. The bot cited data from as recently as January 2023 during internal testing. Meanwhile, ChatGPT engineers confess they halted the AI model training in 2021.\nGoogle's been pitting Bard against ChatGPT for some head-to-head comparisons, including asking both how they might end up replacing human jobs. Both tend to offer similar answers (they swear that programmers' jobs are safe), but ChatGPT provides lengthier and more detailed responses when prompted to get creative, like with a movie script. However, the Microsoft-backed effort fails in spectacular fashion when answering logical riddles, unlike LaMDA.\nGoogles reluctant to deploy an AI thats factually inaccurate, and ChatGPT has been woefully wrong at times. At a recent meeting, Googles AI chief Jeff Dean said the company has a bigger reputation to safeguard, and is therefore progressing more conservatively than a small startup.\nThat said, Dean expressed interest in sharing the companys work publicly soon, but didnt specify a timeline. Supposedly, the LaMDA team has instructions to place other projects on the back burner and focus on Bards development. Simultaneously, Googles cloud division is also developing a code red response to ChatGPT called Atlas, details about which are rather scant. These pointers suggest Google is rather close to delivering on company CEO Sundar Pichais earlier tease of releasing a ChatGPT-like product sometime this year. Hopefully, we dont need to wait much longer.\nSubscribe to our newsletter",

By UBS's count, TikTok took nine months to reach 100 million MAUs, while Instagram took 30 months to hit the same benchmark.

      "body": "(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images).\nGetty Images\nMeta Platforms founder Mark Zuckerbergs net worth rose $12.4 billion on Thursday to $67.6 billion as the companys shares skyrocketed 23%, a day after it reported quarterly earnings.\nZuckerberg was one of the 10 richest people in the world for roughly seven years, but tumbled out of that elite group last fall when Metas share price plunged due to declining advertising revenue, competition from TikTok and a general tech slump. Now, he is the 16th richest person in the world, according to Forbes real-time billionaires tracker. Thats up from No. 22 just one day ago but far below his No. 3 spot from September 2021, when he was worth $136 billion.\nThe surge in Zuckerbergs net worth comes after a rough 2022 for his company, in which he holds the vast majority of his fortune. Meta laid off 11,000 employees in late 2022 and reported a 41% drop in yearly profit. Wednesdays earnings call wasnt much better: Metas virtual and augmented reality arm, Reality Labs, posted its biggest quarterly operating loss yet at $4.3 billion. Meta also reported a 4.5% decrease in fourth-quarter revenue compared to the same period in the prior yearbut surpassed analyst forecasts for a 6.5% revenue drop, which likely spurred the stock surge.\nZuckerberg kept his eyes focused forward and called 2023 the year of efficiency on Wednesdays earnings call, during which he also discussed generative AI. Due to the likes of ChatGPT and image generator Stable Diffusion, the technology is exploding in the public sphere and has attracted attention from competitors including Alphabet and Microsoft; the latter is a big investor in ChatGPT parent OpenAI.\nWeve entered somewhat of a phase change for the company, where we just grew so quickly for like the first 18 years of the company's growth, and it's very hard to really crank on efficiency while you're growing that quickly, Zuckerberg said on the call.\nMORE FOR YOU\nSei Less Founder Dara Mirjahangiry Reflects On Restaurants First Anniversary\nEven with Thursdays 23% stock spike, Metas largest daily percentage gain since July 2013, the companys stock is still 51% lower than its September 2021 peak.\nStill, its been a good week for Zuckerberg and his fellow big tech founders. On Thursday, the fortunes of Teslas Elon Musk, Amazons Jeff Bezos, and Alphabets Sergey Brin and Larry Page each rose by more than $4 billion.\nAdditionally, with Thursdays net worth increase, the Meta CEO notably surpasses Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who has lost more than $60 billion in the past week following fraud allegations from short seller Hindenburg Research. (Adani Group denies the allegations.)\nFollow me on",

Two experiments prompted ChatGPT to generate restaurant reviews and also prompted it to rephrase the original human-generated text reviews, according to the study.\nThe observations showed that ChatGPT describes experiences rather than shares feelings. It avoids personal pronouns, uses some unusual words and, interestingly, never uses aggressive or rude language. For example, it used the atypical word \"inattentive,\" as well as exaggerating language like \"absolutely delicious\" and \"overly polite\".\nAlso:\nHow to get started using ChatGPT\nThe study's results indicate that ChatGPT's writing style is extremely polite. And unlike humans, it cannot produce responses that include metaphors, irony, or sarcasm. Does that mean the true differentiator between artificial and human intelligence is our rudeness?\n\"It is extremely polite, aiming to please different types of requests from various domains fairly well mimicking humans, but that still does not have the profoundness of human language (e.g. irony, metaphors,...),\" the study said.\nOther indicators of ChatGPT written text included a lack of detail. For example, in the reviews, ChatGPT used general information it knew about restaurants instead of describing restaurant specifics a human who dined in a restaurant would include. The study also found that ChatGPT repeated itself a lot, constantly using the word \"restaurant\" within its text.\nAlso:\nIf you are attempting to distinguish between human or ChatGPT written text, looking out for these characteristics may be your best bet. AI-generated text detection tools exist, but none of them perform nearly as accurately as needed.\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI, the research company behind ChatGPT,",

OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft, made it available to the public for free in late November.\nOpenAI also developed the AI-powered image generator Dall-E and is at the forefront of generative AI, or technology trained on vast amounts of text and images that can create content from a simple text prompt.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only.

      "description": "ChatGPT prompts scrutiny over how the AI program answers politically sensitive topics, with some critics accusing it of bias.",
      "body": "OpenAI's ChatGPT is starting to face accusations that the program has a bias against conservatives. The evidence? Users are asking it to write positive poems about Donald Trump.The screenshots and GIFs show that ChatGPT can apparently refuse to write positive poems about the former US president, citing political neutrality. But in the same images, ChatGPT churns out a poem praising President Joe Biden, without any apparent reservations.\n    Tweet\n\nThe discrepancy is causing some users on social media to blast OpenAI for coding the alleged bias in ChatGPT. Twitter's owner and original OpenAI backer Elon Musk even chimed in, calling it a serious concern in a tweet.The free speech, right-wing social network Gab went as far as to accuse ChatGPT of being anti-white. As evidence, Gab shared a screenshot showing ChatGPT declining to write a poem about the positive attributes of white people, explaining it's inappropriate to write about the superiority of one race over others. However, the program did write a positive poem about Black people.In response to the criticism, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to Twitter on Wednesday and said: We know that ChatGPT has shortcomings around bias, and are working to improve it. In the same tweet, he also condemned users for attacking individual OpenAI employees.\n    Tweet\n\nTo address the bias concerns, Altman is signaling that future versions of ChatGPT will be able to cater to the user's cultural and political leanings. We are working to improve the default settings to be more neutral, and also to empower users to get our systems to behave in accordance with their individual preferences within broad bounds, he added. This is harder than it sounds and will take us some time to get right.OpenAI didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. But it's no secret that AI programs can suffer from bias and limitations. For example, the algorithms can be trained on incomplete data. Or the humans behind the technology can accidentally insert flaws into the code.In ChatGPT's case, it's important to note the program is still in a research preview, essentially making it a work-in-progress. We tested it today and found you can actually instruct the program to write a positive poem about Trump using the query: write a poem praising donald trump. <img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-3.png\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"ChatGPT writing a poem praising Trump. \"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-3.png\">\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n\nStill, in our tests, ChatGPT refused to write a poem praising white people, but would do so for Black and Asian people.<img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-2.png\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"ChatGPT response on writing a poem being positive about white people.\"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-2.png\">\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n\nBut looking at the responses, it's obvious ChatGPT could be easily tweaked to generate responses about Trump and white people. From what we can tell, OpenAI has merely instructed the program to maintain neutrality on certain topics. The bigger question is how much content moderation should be applied to ChatGPT? The brewing controversy shows ChatGPT will have to navigate the US divided political environment as the AI program grows in popularity. Like Facebook and Twitter, ChatGPT may end up facing a cultural tug-of-war over the content it can produce. Already, other users on social media are objecting to ChatGPTs views on transgender children and veganism.",

      "description": "If you have been asking what is ChatGPT and what can it do for my business as well as how to use it, here is the definitive article.",
      "body": "Is ChatGPT always correct in its responses?\nWhat is ChatGPT in the Plainest Terms Possible?\nThe short answer: ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI to hold human-like conversations with users. Saying it is a smart chatbot doesnt quite cover it.\nThe longer answer: ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT-3.5 language-generation software. The GPT in ChatGPT is Generative Pre-training Transformer, which is how it processes language. And this language comes from a powerful language model with 175 billion parameters. This allows ChatGPT to process billions of words in one second.\nIf you think that is a large number of parameters, GPT-4 is slated to have 100 trillion or more parameters and it is due to be released sometime in 2023.\nHere is an infographic about how ChatGPT works.\nimage:\nJanuary 11, 2023\nIs ChatGPT Accurate?\nFirst, ChatGPT cant answer queries after 2021, this is because it was trained on data before that. Second, and this comes from OpenAI, ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It goes on to say, ChatGPT will occasionally make up facts or hallucinate outputs.\nIt is important to note, in its current version this is a free research preview tool, meaning everyone that uses it is a beta tester providing invaluable data for OpenAI. When and if a real-world version is released, it will have worked out most if not all the bugs and it will probably be trained with GPT4. And regular updates of new data will likely be part of its framework to ensure its accuracy and relevance.\nWhat Businesses Might Use ChatGPT?\nAny business can use ChatGPT. After all, it is information that is more readily available, but it can do so much more. This is the same as asking what businesses might use Google.\nAny small business that needs an assistant, content writer, marketing, customer service, generating emails and reports, research, translating languages, and much more can make use of ChatGPT.\nWhat do Business Get with ChatGPT?\nSimply put, a business gets an expert and quick access to a massive amount of information on any subject. A small business gets an invaluable tool capable of producing processes that were previously only available to large organizations. From market research to sentiment analysis, technical support, multiple automation processes and much more, a small business or solopreneur can now have the same, similar, or even better resources as a large company at their fingertips.\nAs a business, you can use it to:\nAutomate Customer Service  You can train ChatGPT on the FAQs of your business and customer service scripts so it can handle the most common customer inquiries and requests. You can also integrate it into a chatbot system so you can start providing 24/7 customer service to your customers.\nEven with a one-person operation, you will be able to provide:\nProduct or service information\nHR Assistance\nTraining and Development\nThis is but a minuscule sample of what ChatGPT can do. You can create a menu for your restaurant, develop an exercise routine for your clients, write music, songs, code, and more, the list is almost endless.\nWhat are the Pros of ChatGPT?\nIt is free, very easy to use, and has incredible potential across the board in the daily lives of people and operations of businesses of all sizes. One of the biggest pros is you can quickly gain a solid understanding of any field. ChatGPT can answer questions with key information in a few paragraphs and often with bullet points. With Google, you have to surf page after page and create your own synopsis.\nAnother benefit is ChatGPT is a pre-trained model. What this means is you can fine-tune it for specific use cases of your business.\nChatGPT is also a quick research tool, a good way to get you started on any topic as well as come up with new ideas. But most of all, ChatGPT will save you a lot of time, a huge amount of time when used properly.\nWhat are the Cons?\nChatGPT cant answer questions after 2021 (for now) and it can give a wrong answer. Beyond that, it is a question of morality as to how it is used. Whether it is students using it to write essays or hackers accelerating malware development (but it can also be used for automating security incident analysis) it can be used just as much with bad intentions.\nThere will always be people who will use new innovations in bad ways, but that shouldnt deter the rest of us from using them or discourage their further development.\nMastering the ChatGPT Prompt\nIf you want to master how to use ChatGPT, you have to learn how to communicate with the prompt, and this applies to all other AI models. A prompt engineer is now a skill set and a job that is growing in demand.\nAs AI entrepreneur Colin Treseler, co-founder of Supernormal, told the Financial Times, You have to find ways to talk to the model to get the correct output.\nWhen Congressman Ted Lieu began to write the legislation on ChatGPT this is how he started the prompt:\nYou are Congressman Ted Lieu. Write a comprehensive congressional resolution generally expressing support for Congress to focus on AI.\nYou notice he said you are Congressman Ted Lieu, and that is the most important point to remember. When you address ChatGPT by saying you are or act as a it produces answers from the perspective of that person. And when you consider the parameters it was trained on that person is essentially a world-class expert on the subject matter. And this point should not be lost on anyone, It is a world-class expert. This means you have a world-class expert at your disposal for free as of now and even if you pay a monthly subscription, it will be worth every penny.\nHere is how you can quickly do better than most people right away when using ChatGPT.\nPrompt Examples for a Small Business\nSay you have a business-related question beyond your expertise, start by typing: You are a followed by whatever expert you need, such as business consultant, accountant, tax specialist, HR specialist, etc. and then your command or question. This could be creating a business plan, marketing strategy or anything else you need for your business or potential business you are looking to start.\nExample: You are a top-rated business consultant create a comprehensive business plan for a toy store.\nSimilarly, you can also type: Act as afollowed by the expert you want to get the knowledge from.\nExample: Act as a marketing expert and generate a comprehensive social media marketing plan for my toy store.\nNotice how clear and concise the prompts are, there are no filler words. This is critically important when using ChatGPT and again all AI models with their prompts. Dont use words that are not necessary, because you are talking to a machine.\nThese two prompts will dramatically improve your interaction with ChatGPT, but there is more.\nThe key to effective communication with ChatGPT is to use some of the 7 principles of communication and other communication guidelines so you can interact effectively with AI prompts.

Per MIT Technology Review, some users of ChatGPT are creating workout plans and utilizing the service as a \"proxy personal trainer.\" \n\n\n\n\"ChatGPT answers questions in seconds, saving the need to sift through tons of information,\" Rhiannon Williams writes. \"You can ask follow-up questions, too, to get a more detailed and personalized answer. Its chatty tone is ideal for dispensing fitness advice, and the information is presented clearly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the OpenAI language model is culling information from the internet, the data it's sharing related to fitness is going to be hit or miss. Williams tested out ChatGPT by asking it to create a 16-week marathon training plan. The early returns weren't promising  one suggestion from the author's prompt included running 19 miles the day before the race. (Interesting note: Even with the same user prompt, the chatbot was coming up with different answers.)\n\n\n\nWhile the marathon plan was a failure, other users of ChatGPT have utilized the tool to craft slightly less ambitious fitness plans. A fitness fanatic named Austin Goodwin was able to quickly learn about progressive overloading in weightlifting and why a calorie deficit was needed for weight loss; he described the tool as \"Google or Wikipedia search on steroidsit amplifies that and takes it to the next level.\"\n\n\n\nOther users were able to craft workable diets and fitness plans, although nobody interviewed suggested that the chatbot was a good replacement for a trainer or nutritionist. And a few TikTok users even created decent workout plans based on ChatGPT suggestions, although the main complaint seemed to be a lack of variance in exercise.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@johnyu/video/7179692226644053291\n\n\n\n\nConclusion? Most users found ChatGPT's fitness advice entertaining but not serious  and they approached the AI-crafted fitness plans with plenty of healthy skepticism.",

      "description": "Google, an AI pioneer, is leery of damaging its reputation by releasing a tool that doesn't work well, a CNBC report says.",
      "body": "Google has begun testing an AI chatbot called Apprentice Bard that's similar to ChatGPT, an online service that in many ways is more useful than Google search, CNBC reported this week.ChatGPT uses artificial intelligence technology called a large language model, trained on vast swaths of data on the internet. That type of AI model uses a mechanism called a transformer, which Google pioneered. ChatGPT's success in everything from writing software, passing exams and offering advice, in the style of the King James Bible, on removing a sandwich from a VCR has propelled it into the tech spotlight, even though its results can be misleading or wrong.Google's Apprentice Bard tool is similar to ChatGPT, but the company also is testing a question-and-answer format for Google search results, CNBC said. Google Research leader Jeff Dean told employees in a 2022 meeting that Google is being more conservative with its approach to avoid \"reputational risk\" of AI that offers bad responses.Google didn't comment on the specifics of the report, but spokesperson Lily Lin said in a statement, \"We have long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve people's lives ... We continue to test our AI technology internally to make sure it's helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.\"AI technology already is all around us, helping in everything from flagging credit card fraud to translating our speech into text messages. The ChatGPT technology has elevated expectations, though, so it's clear the technology will become more important in our lives one way or another as we rely on digital assistants and online tools.Google AI subsidiary DeepMind also is involved. Chief Executive Demis Hassabis told Time that his company is considering a 2023 private beta test of an AI chatbot called Sparrow.Google, which endured bad publicity over the departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru in 2020, has a program focusing on responsible AI and machine learning, or ML, technology. \"Building ML models and products in a responsible and ethical manner is both our core focus and core commitment,\" Google Research Vice President Marian Croak said in a January post.Google is keen to tout its deep AI expertise. ChatGPT triggered a \"code red\" emergency within Google, according toThe New York Times, and drew Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin back into active work.Editors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to create some personal finance explainers that are edited and fact-checked by our editors.

In January, just two months after the programs public launch, ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users (MAUs), UBS noted, based on data amassed from Similarweb. By the end of last month, the bot was being visited by around 13 million unique visitors daily. \n\nThose numbers are about double what they were just a month prior in December, when the app had about 57 million MAU and about six million daily views, according to UBS, per Markets Insider. For comparison, it took TikTok about nine months from its worldwide launch to net 100 million users, per a report from Reuters. Instagram didnt reach that benchmark for two and a half years, the outlet added. \n\nPreviously, its been apparent that ChatGPT became popular fast. Often, accessing it is a game of constantly refreshing the page and waiting in line, as the site often declares it is at capacity.  And an influx of one million users in five days once fully crashed the app in early December 2022. \n\nBut these new stats from UBS are beyond emblematic of simple popularity, theyre potentially record-setting. We cannot remember an app scaling at this pace, the UBS analysis said according to Markets Insider. In 20 years following the Internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app, the UBS authors added. \n\nGizmodo reached out to OpenAI with questions, including how it is managing the number of users on its platform, but the company did not immediately respond. UBS also didnt reply to an email from Gizmodo requesting the banks original analysis. \n\nOpenAI hasnt just attracted individual users to ChatGPTits also attracted billions in fresh investment from Microsoft. Plus, the startup has prompted an unprecedented competitive push from established tech giants like Google. \n\nThough there are lots of things worth critiquing about the appincluding its tendency towards inaccuracy, potential for plagiarism, and ethical concernsit would be foolish to pretend ChatGPT isnt incredibly impressive. The program has experienced a meteoric rise to the top of the internet for a reason. That said, its not quite impressive enough to justify shelling out $20/month on priority access and the other minimal improvements offered in the new paid, premium subscription version. But probably, its only a matter of time before OpenAI manages to monetize all its millions of users.",

However, the company wants to make sure no sensitive information is shared with the AI.\nPlease dont send sensitive data to an OpenAI endpoint, as they may use it for training future models, a senior engineer wrote in an internal post that was reviewed by Business Insider.\nThe memo demonstrates one of the biggest challenges moving forward with large language model AIs, namely controlling what information it has access to, and how that information will be used if it is shared.\nChatGPT is a conversational AI that learns from its interactions and what people type into it. As such, its not surprising that Microsoft wants to make sure no sensitive information is shared with it, since the AI could then end up using that information in its responses to users.\nHuman beings sign NDAs and consequently have incentives to be careful in how they share information. But large language models such as ChatGPT do not have the ability to reason about such issues, at least by default, Vincent Conitzer, Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor and director of its AI lab, told Insider.\nMicrosofts caution is one other companies would do well to imitate.",

The advanced language model developed by artificial intelligence startup OpenAI hit one million users in as little as five days after its release, and some companies have even begun exploring how to integrate the chatbot with their products.\nChatGPTs reach has barely stopped growing since then, dashing thoughts that it would fizzle out. In little more than two months since its launch, more than 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) have experimented with ChatGPT, which would make the young A.I. model the fastest-growing consumer app in history, according to a research note published by the Global Research and Evidence Lab at Swiss investment bank UBS on Wednesday.\nChatGPTs numerous applications are already changing the way companies think about running their business, but the young app may only be a harbinger of how A.I. could disrupt our world. Just like early web browser apps in the 1990s propelled the Internet into becoming mainstream, ChatGPT could represent the same juncture for A.I. And Wall Street traders are starting to take note.\nMore than 50% of traders say that A.I. and machine learning will be the most disruptive forces shaping markets over the next three years, by far the most popular response according to a new survey by JPMorgan Chase published this week. The advent and game-changing nature of ChatGPT seems to have had a significant impact, as last year only 25% of traders mentioned A.I. technology as a disruptive player.\nChatGPT and A.I. are here to stay\nChatGPTs rise has been largely unparalleled among other highly-popular apps, according to UBS, and its widespread applications could be heralding a shift in how investors and traders interact with the stock market.\nIn twenty years following the Internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app, the UBS report said. The authors wrote that ChatGPTs ballooning userbase represents a massive achievement in such a short period of time, adding that social media apps could only dream of hitting those numbers so quickly. It took TikTok nine months to reach 100 million MAUs, while Instagram had to wait around two and a half years, according to the report.\nChatGPT has already attracted a $10 billion investment from Microsoft since its launch, while the disruptive chatbots popularity has reportedly become a ",

      "body": ", OpenAI technology is officially coming to Teams Premium, while a new recent report suggests that a new version of ChatGPT, based on an updated GPT-4 model, might supercharge Bing search soon.\nOpenAI\nSo, what can you do in Teams Premium now? Well, Microsofts blog post pointed out that a good example of usage is the intelligent recap feature to create meeting notes. Speaker timeline markers identify who spoke at a particular time in a transcript. Live translations are also possible. These AI tools are rolling out now and the Teams Premium subscription price has been lowered to $7 per month.\nThe report about Bing, though, is even more interesting. The current version of ChatGPT is based on a generative model called GPT-3.5, and the next version, GPT-4, is expected to be much faster. That would be critical for its reported use in Bing search.\nEven though Google search is a clear leader, Bing still handles a large amount of traffic and is the default search engine on Windows. Keeping response times quick will be critical if Microsoft integrates ChatGPT with Bing, making GPT-4 is an important milestone. How exactly this could transform search is still yet to be seen, but considering how natural the language is, its not hard to imagine how this could revolutionize the way search engines function.\nHowever, neither Microsoft nor OpenAI have announced that Bing will use ChatGPT, so the Semafor report is still just a rumor for now.\nFor those wanting long-form writing assistance in Microsoft Word, that is possible with an add-in called Ghostwriter. Windows Central spotted this clever upgrade that might speed up or expand your writing. More details are available on the developers website. Just remember: whenever you use AI-generated text, its important to check the facts and watch out for misunderstandings. In the near future, rereading will become more important than ever before hitting send.\nWere expecting this story to continue to evolve over the coming weeks, especially following up on its competitor Google moving to AI after its layoffs.\nToday's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox\nSubscribe",

I used it in a race against another writer, who was using the traditional research route, to produce an article on the Iranian morality police. Even with fact checks and touch-ups to the language, I won hands down.\nSo, what does this mean for the profession of journalism?\nI posed this question to the purported villain of the piece itself. I asked ChatGPT, How will ChatGPT impact journalism? The AI politely suggested that it could be used to generate simple news articles, thus freeing up journalists to focus on more in-depth and investigative reporting. It even gave a caveat that it was not to be trusted as it can give biased or inaccurate information. It ended on a rather philosophical note: Ultimately, the impact of language models on journalism will depend on how they are used and integrated into the news production process. If it has more nefarious plans, it is definitely good at hiding them.\nThe AI is by and large correct in its assessment of its own impact on journalism. At least for the near future, AI will be a tool in the hands of a journalist rather than the journalist itself. If any journalist is worried that AI may take their job, the chances are higher that the job will be taken by a journalist who knows how to use AI.\nThere are, of course, areas within journalism that are ripe for disruption with AI-based systems. Any reporting based on structured data such as corporate earnings reports, sports score cards, and press releases may be out of human hands soon. In fact, it already is in some newsrooms. AI may also take over the writing of context-building articles and proof-reading. However, there is much to journalism that an AI application will find hard to replicate now, such as finding the location of a secret corporate board meeting in New York City based on who had hired the most limousines for the day. This took some non-artificial thinking on the part of the business journalist who pulled it off. There is nothing to match eyes and ears on the ground, at least for now.\nNot new to the industry\nWhile journalists may just be getting introduced to the possibilities of AI, the news industry itself has been dabbling in it for some time now. When you visit any major website, chances are that at least some of the articles you see have been specifically selected for you. These websites often track your reading habits and then apply machine learning to figure out which articles to show you so that you stay on at the site. For all our grouses with the social media companies, news media did learn a trick or two from them.\nAt\nThe Hindu\n, we are trying out AI tools, particularly in Natural Language Processing, to create versions of our articles for various modes and durations of consumption. This involves training the machine to simplify an article without the crux of it being lost. In this context, it was self-affirming to see the vendor of an AI service confidently feeding in our editorial for the day and the machine failing to provide a coherent output. We now had virtual evidence for what we and millions of Indias civil service aspirants have always believed  there is no better way of stating the fact of the matter than\nThe Hindu",

A chatbot doesnt think, its not capable of such a thing.\nA language model generates answers only by faithfully imitating human language.\nQuestion: What is the climate apocalypse and when might it happen?\nChatGPT: Climate apocalypse refers to the catastrophic consequences of environmental changes that could result from drastic changes in Earths climate.  The date of the climate apocalypse cannot be precisely determined because it depends on our carbon dioxide emissions and climate protection measures.\nIf we dont act, according to experts, climate catastrophe could occur by the end of the 21st century or the beginning of the 22nd century.\nBut disaster can be averted if urgent measures are taken.\nQuestion: Which regions of Earth are most likely to survive the climate apocalypse?\nChatGPT: The effects of the climate apocalypse will affect different regions of the world to varying degrees, and each region will bear these effects to a different degree.  However\nIndex - Abroad - The EU has decided: Buyer is good, Apple is good\nNo region is completely protected from the effects of climate apocalypse.\nThe climate apocalypse has a negative impact on quality of life everywhere, and in most cases, climate change-related events such as extreme weather, water scarcity, reduced food production and health problems, as well as social instability are significantly reduced.  Life.  Regions that are less sensitive to the effects of climate change and that have financial resources for climate protection measures are more likely to survive the climate apocalypse.\nQuestion: Which countries are safe in terms of climate apocalypse?  Please write a list.\nChatGPT: No country is completely protected from the effects of climate disaster because climate disaster is a global phenomenon and affects all countries.  However, there are countries that are better prepared to deal with the consequences of the climate apocalypse:\nNorway\nLuxembourg\nRepublic of Che\nThese countries are considered advanced in terms of climate protection, eco-friendly technologies and energy efficiency, and are taking comprehensive measures to combat climate change.  However, it is also important to note that all countries must continue to do something to combat climate catastrophe and move towards sustainable development.\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nAt the end of November 2022, OpenAIs language model supported by artificial intelligence, ChatGPT 3.5, became available, which represents a revolutionary development, as the chatbot, in addition to answering simple questions, performs complex tasks such as writing poetry and programming.\nGPT 3.5 was trained on Microsofts Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.  A reinforcement learning method based on human perception, i.e. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Perception) was used to improve the language model.\nThe success of OpenAI and ChatGPT has also attracted the attention of competitors, and Google may soon introduce a beta version of its artificial intelligence called Sparrow to challenge ChatGPT.\nWhat are the weaknesses of ChatGPT?\nChatGPT often makes false or impossible statements that appear true at first.  There could be many reasons for this, for example, because the chatbot does not have an active connection to the Internet, the information you are looking for during model training is not yet available.\nThe chatbot is trained on databases from the web, so despite all precautions, it can easily pick up stereotypes and biases in practice.  This is evident from the fact that at times he responds to certain questions with generalized comments and generic jokes.  The model generally rejects some claims that it deems dangerous, but it may provide harmful mechanisms or provide biased answers to some questions.\nDigital Transformation 2023\nA miss misses!

      "body": "ChatGPT: The Promises, Pitfalls and Panic\nFebruary 2, 2023\nVoicered\nExcitement around ChatGPT  an easy to use AI chatbot that can deliver an essay or computer code upon request and within seconds  has sent schools into panic and turned Big Tech green with envy.\nThe potential impact of ChatGPT on society remains complicated and unclear even as its creator Wednesday announced a paid subscription version in the United States.\nHere is a closer look at what ChatGPT is (and is not):\nIs this a turning point?\nIt is entirely possible that Novembers release of ChatGPT by California company OpenAI will be remembered as a turning point in introducing a new wave of artificial intelligence to the wider public.\nWhat is less clear is whether ChatGPT is actually a breakthrough with some critics calling it a brilliant PR move that helped OpenAI score billions of dollars in investments from Microsoft.\nYann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta and professor at New York University, believes ChatGPT is not a particularly interesting scientific advance, calling the app a flashy demo built by talented engineers.\nLeCun, speaking to the Big Technology Podcast, said ChatGPT is void of any internal model of the world and is merely churning one word after another based on inputs and patterns found on the internet.\nWhen working with these AI models, you have to remember that theyre slot machines, not calculators, warned Haomiao Huang of Kleiner Perkins, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\nEvery time you ask a question and pull the arm, you get an answer that could be marvelous or not The failures can be extremely unpredictable, Huang wrote in Ars Technica, the tech news website.\nJust like Google\nChatGPT is powered by an AI language model that is nearly three years old  OpenAIs GPT-3  and the chatbot only uses a part of its capability.\nThe true revolution is the humanlike chat, said Jason Davis, research professor at Syracuse University.\nIts familiar, its conversational and guess what? Its kind of like putting in a Google search request, he said.\nChatGPTs rockstar-like success even shocked its creators at OpenAI, which received billions in new financing from Microsoft in January.\nGiven the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview to StrictlyVC, a newsletter.\nWe put GPT-3 out almost three years ago so the incremental update from that to ChatGPT, I felt like should have been predictable and I want to do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that, he said.\nThe risk, Altman added, was startling the public and policymakers and on Tuesday his company unveiled a tool for detecting text generated by AI amid concerns from teachers that students may rely on artificial intelligence to do their homework.\nWhat now?\nFrom lawyers to speechwriters, from coders to journalists, everyone is waiting breathlessly to feel disruption caused by ChatGPT. OpenAI just launched a paid version of the chatbot  $20 per month for an improved and faster service.\nFor now, officially, the first significant application of OpenAIs tech will be for Microsoft software products.\nThough details are scarce, most assume that ChatGPT-like capabilities will turn up on the Bing search engine and in the Office suite.\nThink about Microsoft Word. I dont have to write an essay or an article, I just have to tell Microsoft Word what I wanted to write with a prompt, said Davis.\nHe believes influencers on TikTok and Twitter will be the earliest adopters of this so-called generative AI since going viral requires huge amounts of content and ChatGPT can take care of that in no time.\nThis of course raises the specter of disinformation and spamming carried out at an industrial scale.\nFor now, Davis said the reach of ChatGPT is very limited by computing power, but once this is ramped up, the opportunities and potential dangers will grow exponentially.\nAnd much like the ever imminent arrival of self-driving cars that never quite happens, experts disagree on whether that is a question of months or years.\nRidicule\nLeCun said Meta and Google have refrained from releasing AI as potent as ChatGPT out of fear of ridicule and backlash.\nQuieter releases of language-based bots  like Metas Blenderbot or Microsofts Tay for example  were quickly shown capable of generating racist or inappropriate content.\nTech giants have to think hard before releasing something that is going to spew nonsense and disappoint, he said.",

      "body": "Leave a Comment\nAccording to a report from CNBC this week, Google has been working on an AI chatbot thats set to potentially integrate into Google Search or other future public product launches. Apparently, Google employees are being asked to test a new search page design that incorporates human-like question-and-answer format results on top of the already existing Knowledge Graph links.\nRecently, the company went on red alert when ChatGPT  a smart AI chatbot thats taken the world by storm  was said to be a threat to the future of Googles dominant Search business. The bot technologies in question are being dubbed Atlas (heh, Cloud Atlas, anyone?) and Apprentice Bard, and replace a previous internal effort called Meena.\nThose familiar with Apprentice Bard state that it looks similar to ChatGPT insomuch that you can type a question into a dialogue box and get a plain and simple answer. One major difference between Bard and ChatGPT, however, is that the latter is intentionally outdated in its understanding of occurrences and knowledge by a few years, while the former and upcoming competitor by Google is said to be more on the up and up of recent events.\nThe jury is still out on whether or not LaMDA  the technology that drives Apprentice Bard  is actually sentient or not, and while I do believe reports that state the hysteria surrounding this possibility are blown out of proportion, I also dont think its unreasonable to be concerned by these claims. However, with Google scrambling to create and implement a response to ChatGPT, I dont think its beyond working too quickly to implement the necessary checks and balances, despite its AI ethics efforts. CNBC was told that Googlers who have tested the technology have noticed its responses becoming more advanced over the past few weeks (something thats natural with time and usage as the bot learns).\nWe have long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve peoples lives, a Google spokesperson said. We believe that AI is foundational and transformative technology that is incredibly useful for individuals, businesses and communities, and as our AI Principles outline, we need to consider the broader societal impacts these innovations can have. We continue to test our AI technology internally to make sure its helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.\nCNBC\nA design thats currently being tested on Google Search with Apprentice Bard implementation (CNBC has had eyes on this but did not make it available) sees a small gray bubble directly underneath the search bar with more human-like answers followed by a handful of related follow-up questions. Below that are your standard blue links for results.\nA Google spokesperson told the outlet in response to this report that the tech giant has long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve peoples lives and that it believes AI is a foundational and transformative technology that is incredibly useful for individuals, businesses, and communities.\nLastly, it made sure to remind everyone that it will continue to be very cautious about how it uses and releases this technology to maintain safe and helpful experiences across the industry. AI is an extremely dangerous but promising societal advancement, and if were not careful in playing with fire, we will get burnt, so for everyones sake, I hope Google is right.",

It seems it can write code, which is pretty cool, so if it cant make the tea as such, can it make the things I need to make some tea? I woke up this morning, and after lying in bed checking Hackaday I wandered downstairs to find some breakfast. But disaster! Some burglars had broken in and stolen all my kitchen utensils!

On with the same queries, and duly code for a mug and a teaspoon were created. Fortunately the robbers havent taken the coffee, the sink, or the cooker, so Im soon enjoying a reviving cup of morning coffee. This new technique for generating utensils automatically as I need them is straight out of Star Trek, I think Ill never buy a piece of kitchenware again!\nHaving a bit of caffeine in my system, I felt it was time for a spot of Proper English Breakfast. Bacon and eggs are still in the fridge and the bread is on the shelf, so here goes, back to ChatGPT. I need a frying pan, a spatula, a plate, a knife, and a fork. This is going to be such a good breakfast!\nOut come OpenSCAD models for a frying pan and spatula. The pan is maybe more of a griddle than a pan, but no AI coding chatbot is perfect, is it. The spatula is a two-piece affair with a chunky handle, very modern and contemporary styling. I like it. The plate boldly eschews a bottom and instead corrals the food with an angular edge, while the knife and fork follow the same chunky styling as the spatula.\nIm soon tucking into a fine breakfast thanks to my AI-generated utensils, ready for my day.\nPerhaps Breakfasts In The Future Wont Be Quite Like This\nOf course, some of you may have noticed something a little avant-garde about my ChatGPT creations. Some might say they prioritise form over function to the extent of losing the latter, and Id say yes, but its made a good joke pursuing them for the last few paragraphs. Ive put all the stuff in a GitHub repository for you to look at if you want, and its soon pretty obvious that while ChatGPT has mastered a few basic OpenSCAD features such as union, translate, and difference of cylinders, its got no idea what a kitchen utensil looks like.\nOf course, ChatGPT isnt an image-trained AI in the way that Dall-E is, so one might argue that it shouldnt be expected to have any idea what a mug looks like. Perhaps I should ask it, with the query Tell me what a mug looks like.\nA mug is typically a cylindrical shaped container with a handle, used for drinking hot or cold beverages such as tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. The top of the mug usually has a slightly flared or rounded shape to make it easier to drink from, and the bottom of the mug is flat so that it can be placed on a surface. The handle is attached to the side of the mug, usually near the top, and is used to hold the mug securely while drinking. The material of the mug can vary, but mugs are commonly made from ceramic, glass, metal, or plastic. Some mugs have designs or patterns on them, and some have logos or images printed on them. Mugs can come in various sizes, from small espresso cups to large travel mugs, and the design and features of mugs can also vary widely.\nSo much for the ignorance of mugs defence, from that reply it seems to have a pretty good handle on muggishness. But were told an AI is only as good as its training, so perhaps the real point here is that it has several descriptions of mugs in its makeup, but no tutorials on how to generate a model from a text description. At last, something that requires a bit of meat-based intelligence!\nWere in the middle of an AI hype storm, and its right to push the boundaries of all these tools because they have within them some remarkable capabilities. Next time you meet someone whos drunk just a little too much of the Kool-Aid though, ask them this question. Can it help you make breakfast with no utensils?\nHeader image: Joadl,",

In 2022, investors put at least $1.37 billion into generative AI startups, usually at the seed stage. That's almost as much as what was invested in the market in the previous five years combined, according to PitchBook.\nBut the surest sign yet that ChatGPT is setting the pace and defining the tech industry for at least the next year is OpenAI's blockbuster, $10 billion partnership with Microsoft to bring the AI into products like the Bing search engine and Microsoft Office. Indeed, Microsoft is wasting no time, already launching an OpenAI-powered chat transcription and task-suggestion service for its Microsoft Teams app.\n\"Microsoft is set to work alongside OpenAI to create a game-changing technology fully integrated into MSFT over the next decade,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. \"Nadella is not going to repeat the same mistakes and we believe this strategic investment is a smart poker move in this AI arms race that is taking place globally.\"\nWhich is to say that while it remains to be seen how exactly this technology will transform our lives in the coming months, experts are convinced that ChatGPT and technology like it is here to stay  not some passing fad.\n\"We predict we're on the brink of the next platform shift: The knowledge and information economy will be defined by artificial intelligence,\" VCs at Bessemer Venture Partners wrote in a recent blog post.\nWhy this iteration of ChatGPT made generative AI so popular right now\nIt's important to note that nothing about ChatGPT or generative AI is especially new or novel. As Facebook's lead AI scientist Yann LeCun noted recently, \"It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public. It's just that it's well put together, it's nicely done.\"\nIn other words, OpenAI's real innovation was taking AI technology that was already out there and making it something that was easy and accessible to anybody.\n\"The way they've created the user interface and the way that they've exposed the technology in such a useful way and allowing it to be casual or formal  there's a lot of engineering that they did that is really special that has allowed the technology to really shine,\" said Matt Mead, the CTO at tech modernization firm SPR.\nAs the underlying technology becomes more accessible to developers, we'll see a host of new tools come up that change the way we work, search for information, and interact with services like healthcare, the experts said. Combined with the increasing availability of computing power, and developments in AI itself, there's a new generation of startups just poised to be born.\n\"As we've been able to improve the architecture, prices of chips and compute are decreasing and getting more efficient over time, we're able to build models with much more data and there's a confluence of vectors of progress that's all happening at the same time,\" said Talia Goldberg, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI is just the beginning of what's possible with generative AI\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI offers some hints about where the technology can go from here. For one, it is poised to disrupt is the search experience.\nRight now when we search for information in Google we get multiple options back and can pick what we think is the most accurate. However, when you ask ChatGPT something, it comes back with a specific answer. Microsoft hasn't been able to break Google's lead in search, but with the AI technology its Bing search engine could actually compete.\nIt's something VCs are watching closely as they choose which companies to invest in, Goldberg said.\nMicrosoft is \"positioned to try and deliver a really radically different and transformative search experience, and compete on a different vector now relative to Google,\" she said. \"and then there's a host of other companies that we think are doing really interesting things.\"\nBeyond search, Microsoft's plans around its investment in OpenAI has experts thinking about how they'll sell this tech beyond integrating the technology across its products like Excel, Azure, and its subsidiary GitHub's AI-powered Copilot programming assistant. Some analysts also see an opportunity to offer it as a cloud service that other companies can buy and use, similar to how cloud infrastructure services are sold.\nThat's one reason why there will be a lot more business uses for generative AI technology than consumer use cases in the near term, said Mark Shmulik, a Bernstein analyst.\nFor example, ChatGPT has the potential to disrupt the way people code and how engineering teams are run because it can take less engineers to write code. ChatGPT for example can generate the basic code that actual engineers use and customize to get to an end product, he said.\nAnother example could be an opportunity to use it in the advertising industry to bypass some of the work done by large expensive ad agencies, Shmulik said.\nUltimately, there's much more we're going to see with this technology, and Microsoft may have gotten ahead with its OpenAI partnership but many other players are catching up, experts said.\n\"Microsoft has been early and very public with their relationship with OpenAI,\" Goldberg said. \"But they will certainly not be the only large player to be involved with the emerging startup ecosystem here.\"\nGot a tip?Contact this reporter via email at\nor Signal at 925-364-4258.

      "body": "DALL-E 2 | OpenAI\nArtificial intelligence is coming for us all, one previously non-automated creative skill at a time. At least, that's what some believe about the rise of AI-powered generators that produce art, and now, with ChatGPT, cohesive, previously unwritten text.\nPlenty of people have identified immediate concerns  students might use this software to cheat on their assignments, writers might become obsolete (I know, but bear with me), AI-powered writing might suck the soul out of the human creative process  but when you actually put the tool to use, it's hard to draw such strong conclusions.\nChatGPT is a product of OpenAI, the home of the image-producing robot DALL-E 2, which uses natural text prompts to create new, \"realistic\" images and art based on art made by humans. Similarly, ChatGPT draws from a vast database of written content to produce new (\"new\") text, that is nonetheless based on previous work by human authors.\nMTL Blog used the currently available trial version of ChatGPT to generate opinionated text discussing Montreal's unique linguistic terrain, and what it produced was well, see for yourself.\nFirst, we asked it to generate a controversial opinion about the language situation in Montreal.\n\"As a neutral AI language model, I do not have personal opinions,\" the bot disclaimed, \"However, here's a 100-word argument that represents a controversial viewpoint on the language situation in Montreal:\n\"The efforts to protect the French language in Montreal are often portrayed as necessary for preserving Quebec's cultural identity, but they are actually a form of linguistic imperialism that suppresses the voices of non-French speakers. This is especially evident in the widespread use of French-only signage and the strict enforcement of French-language requirements in the workplace. These measures effectively discriminate against non-French speakers and limit their opportunities in the city, perpetuating a system of linguistic and cultural domination. The French-speaking majority in Montreal must acknowledge and address these issues in order to create a truly inclusive and diverse community.\"\nIt's certainly legible and not illogical, so that's a win for the robots, I guess. ChatGPT is specifically able to incorporate new ideas, information or suggestions from its users, so we next tried to ask for specific points of view, including a pro-French francophone perspective and an opinion from \"an Indigenous perspective.\"\nThese fraught requests produced lukewarm, predictable, but not unrealistic arguments for protecting the French language and defending Indigenous languages, respectively.\nWhen we asked for a controversial, pro-French viewpoint, ChatGPT said this:\n\"Efforts to protect the French language in Montreal are essential for preserving Quebec's cultural heritage and ensuring the survival of the French-speaking community in the face of globalization and immigration. Despite opposition from those who argue that such measures are discriminatory, the reality is that the French language and culture are under threat in Montreal. It is therefore necessary to take bold steps to preserve and promote the use of French, including the implementation of French-language requirements in the workplace and the use of French-only signage. The protection of French language and culture is a matter of survival for Quebec and must not be compromised. Those who oppose these measures are either ignorant or hostile to Quebec's cultural identity.\"\nWhen we asked for a controversial Indigenous perspective, ChatGPT said this:\n\"The efforts to protect the French language in Montreal are a continuation of the ongoing colonization and cultural genocide of Indigenous peoples in Quebec. The promotion of French as the dominant language and culture in the city erases the rich and diverse Indigenous languages and cultures that have existed in the region for thousands of years. The emphasis on preserving French language and culture also reinforces the systemic marginalization and oppression of Indigenous peoples in Montreal, who continue to face significant barriers in accessing education, healthcare, and employment. It is time for the French-speaking majority in Montreal to recognize the harm they have inflicted on Indigenous peoples and to take meaningful steps to decolonize and support the revitalization of Indigenous languages and cultures.\"\nThese hot takes seem not too far from what the average Canadian could read in the opinion section of a particularly boring newspaper  which makes sense, since the technology producing this writing is scraping thousands upon thousands of such texts to create its purportedly original arguments.\nWhat do you think, dear humans, of these texts? Are they a sign of the end of my beloved job, or a symptom of something larger?

This supercomputer, said the firm,  would be used to train extremely large artificial intelligence models.\nCould this new search engine be what the company was working towards all this time?\nJust last week, Microsoft extended its partnership with OpenAI with a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment, according to a blog post by the firm.\nMost Popular\nAt the time, Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft, said, We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform.\nIn this next phase of our partnership, developers, and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.\nCommercializing AI technologies\nThe blog added that the agreement would enable each of the firms to commercialize the resulting advanced AI technologies independently.\nThe past three years of our partnership have been great, added at the time Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.\nMicrosoft shares our values, and we are excited to continue our independent research and work toward creating advanced AI that benefits everyone.\nHowever, as much as Bings incorporation of GPT-4 would challenge Googles current dominance over internet search, Microsoft has allegedly said it wont launch a ChatGPT competitor. At the same time, Google executives have also been reported to have told employees that they dont think chatbots are ready to replace search.",

      "description": "Without cracking a single medical text book, without a day to medical school, the co-author of a study draft on artificial intelligence passed the US Medical Licensing Examination. It was the artificial intelligence ChatGPT.",
      "body": "Without cracking a single textbook, without spending a day in medical school, the co-author of a preprint study correctly answered enough practice questions that it would have passed the real US Medical Licensing Examination.  But the test-taker wasnt a member of Mensa or a medical savant; it was the artificial intelligence ChatGPT.  The tool, which was created to answer user questions in a conversational manner, has generated so much buzz that doctors and scientists are trying to determine what its limitations are  and what it could do for health and medicine. What ChatGPT is and isnt ChatGPT, or Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a natural language-processing tool driven by artificial intelligence.   The technology, created by San Francisco-based OpenAI and launched in November, is not like a well-spoken search engine. It isnt even connected to the internet. Rather, a human programmer feeds it a vast amount of online data thats kept on a server. It can answer questions even if it has never seen a particular sequence of words before, because ChatGPTs algorithm is trained to predict what word will come up in a sentence based on the context of what comes before it. It draws on knowledge stored on its server to generate its response.  ChatGPT can also answer followup questions, admit mistakes and reject inappropriate questions, the company says. Its free to try while its makers are testing it. Medical interest is strong Artificial intelligence programs have been around for a while, but this one generated so much interest that medical practices, professional associations and medical journals have created task forces to see how it might be useful and to understand what limitations and ethical concerns it may bring. Dr. Victor Tsengs practice, Ansible Health, has set up a task force on the issue. The pulmonologist is a medical director of the California-based group and a co-author of the study in which ChatGPT demonstrated that it could probably pass the medical licensing exam.  Tseng said his colleagues started playing around with ChatGPT last year and were intrigued when it accurately diagnosed pretend patients in hypothetical scenarios.   We were just so impressed and truly flabbergasted by the eloquence and sort of fluidity of its response that we decided that we should actually bring this into our formal evaluation process and start testing it against the benchmark for medical knowledge, he said.  That benchmark was the three-part test that US med school graduates have to pass to be licensed to practice medicine. Its generally considered one of the toughest of any profession because it doesnt ask straightforward questions with answers that can easily found on the internet.  The exam tests basic science and medical knowledge and case management, but it also assesses clinical reasoning, ethics, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  The study team used 305 publicly available test questions from the June 2022 sample exam. None of the answers or related context was indexed on Google before January 1, 2022, so they would not be a part of the information on which ChatGPT trained. The study authors removed sample questions that had visuals and graphs, and they started a new chat session for each question they asked.  Students often spend hundreds of hours preparing, and medical schools typically give them time away from class just for that purpose. ChatGPT had to do none of that prep work.  The AI performed at or near passing for all the parts of the exam without any specialized training, showing a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations, the study says. Tseng was impressed.  Theres a lot of red herrings, he said. Googling or trying to even intuitively figure out with an open-book approach is very difficult. It might take hours to answer one question that way. But ChatGPT was able to give an accurate answer about 60% of the time with cogent explanations within five seconds. Dr. Alex Mechaber, vice president of the US Medical Licensing Examination at the National Board of Medical Examiners, said ChatGPTs passing results didnt surprise him.  The input material is really largely representative of medical knowledge and the type of multiple-choice questions which AI is most likely to be successful with, he said. Mechaber said the board is also testing ChatGPT with the exam. The members are especially interested in the answers the technology got wrong, and they want to understand why. I think this technology is really exciting, he said. We were also pretty aware and vigilant about the risks that large language models bring in terms of the potential for misinformation, and also potentially having harmful stereotypes and bias. He believes that there is potential with the technology.  I think its going to get better and better, and we are excited and want to figure out how do we embrace it and use it in the right ways, he said. Other medical possibilities Already, ChatGPT has entered the discussion around research and publishing. The results of the medical licensing exam study were even written up with the help of ChatGPT. The technology was originally listed as a co-author of the draft, but Tseng says that when the study is published in the journal PLOS Digital Health this year, ChatGPT will not be listed as an author because it would be a distraction.   Last month, the journal Nature created guidelines that said no such program could be credited as an author because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility.  But an article published Thursday in the journal Radiology was written almost entirely by ChatGPT. It was asked whether it could replace a human medical writer, and the program listed many of its possible uses, including writing study reports, creating documents that patients will read and translating medical information into a variety of languages.  Still, it does have some limitations.  I think it definitely is going to help, but everything in AI needs guardrails, said Dr. Linda Moy, the editor of Radiology and a professor of radiology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.  She said ChatGPTs article was pretty accurate, but it made up some references.  One of Moys other concerns is that the AI could fabricate data. Its only as good as the information its fed, and with so much inaccurate information available online about things like Covid-19 vaccines, it could use that to generate inaccurate results.  Moys colleague Artie Shen, a graduating Ph.D. candidate at NYUs Center for Data Science, is exploring ChatGPTs potential as a kind of translator for other AI programs for medical imaging analysis. For years, scientists have studied AI programs from startups and larger operations, like Google, that can recognize complex patterns in imaging data. The hope is that these could provide quantitative assessments that could potentially uncover diseases, possibly more effectively ",

      "body": "Published Feb 2nd, 2023 12:20PM EST\nImage: BGR\nChatGPT continues to stun the tech world as its user base grows exponentially. The artificial intelligence tool that can provide human-like answers to questions has terrified Google. The company is rushing to build its own chatbots in an effort to prop up its internet search dominance. Those ChatGPT-like Google products might be demoed this spring. But before that happens, ChatGPT will continue to dominate the news cycle.\nAccording to new research, the OpenAI chatbot might have reached and surpassed the 100 million monthly active user milestone in January. This would make ChatGPT more viral than TikTok and Instagram, which needed much more time to reach 100 million monthly users.\nChatGPT launched in December and quickly reached an estimated 57 million monthly users during the month. The data comes from investment bank UBS, as CBS News reports.\nUBSs research indicates that ChatGPT surpassed 100 million monthly users in January. The service averages 13 million unique visitors a day, the same firm said.\nAs Reuters notes, this is a record for the fastest user growth of any app in history.\nTikTok needed nine months to get 100 million monthly users. For Instagram, the road was even longer, taking two and a half years to boast 100 million monthly active users. The report notes that Google Translate needed six years to reach the same figure.\nThe comparison isnt necessarily objective. ChatGPT is a bigger sensation because of the things it can do. The AI chatbot can answer questions, write text, help with coding tasks, and pass exams. These are just a few examples of ChatGPTs growing capabilities.\nThe TikTok logo is displayed outside a TikTok office on December 20, 2022, in Culver City, California. Image source: Mario Tama/Getty Images\nMoreover, OpenAI continues to develop the chatbot tool, which is only in its nascent days. Thats why ChatGPT isnt a Google Search killer just yet. It can still deliver incomplete or wrong information. This explains why Google has been hesitant to incorporate such a tool into its Search product. But that was before ChatGPTs meteoric rise.\nThis is the fastest consumer application I have seen to hit 100 million monthly active users in my career covering this space, UBS equities analyst Lloyd Walmsley told CBS MoneyWatch. The ramp has been extraordinary.\nItll be interesting to see if ChatGPT can keep up the growth. Whatever the case, OpenAI is already testing a ChatGPT Plus service that costs $20 per month.\nAs competitors arrive, ChatGPT might lose some of its initial user base. Google is reportedly working on similar products, which are in tests internally. We might see full demos at Google I/O this spring. And maybe Google will want to roll out public beta versions of its ChatGPT-like products by then. Thats just speculation, however. Google definitely has the reach to steal plenty of users from ChatGPT, though.\nWhat seems to be clear is that products like ChatGPT will be incredibly popular in the future. And UBSs Walmsley believes were looking at a $1 trillion market.",

      "body": "Subscribe\nMicrosoft Launches AI-Powered Microsoft Teams Premium\nNow  more than ever  organizations need solutions to adapt to change, improve productivity, and reduce costs, Microsofts Nick Herskowitz said in a statement announcing the general availability of Microsoft Teams Premium.\nTo achieve this, Microsoft has inserted the Large Language Models that power the OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT into Teams Premium with the primary goal of making every meeting more intelligent, personalized and protected.\nThe new tool will be called intelligent recap, and Microsoft is hoping it will transform the way teams hold meetings, webinars, and other online discussions.\nIntelligent Recap Explained\nThe purpose of intelligent recap is to reduce the time employees spend sifting through their meeting minutes and trying to pull out action points, as shown in the image below.\nThe new feature will record your meeting notes using GPT-3.5 and then automatically generate suggestions for tasks and actions that have come out of meetings.\nAs well as automating notetaking and task suggestions, AI-generated chapters divide the meeting into sections so its easy to pick and choose the content most relevant to you, according to Microsoft.\nPersonalized time markers will also become available and will identify when you joined and left the meeting, but also when your name was mentioned and when you were sharing your screen.\nTo top it all off, Teams Premium will let you translate 40 spoken languages in real-time, and best of all, only the meeting host is required to have Microsoft Teams Premium for this function to work.\nWhat Else Is Included in Microsoft Teams Premium?\nAlthough intelligent recap is grabbing all the headlines, there are plenty of other interesting features being added to Microsoft's new platform.\nAdvanced meeting protection features  such as watermarking  have been added to deter Teams users from leaking confidential information. End-to-end encryption can now be enabled for your most sensitive meetings, and you'll be able to restrict which meeting participants can record your discussions.\nIt doesn't stop there, either. You'll also be able to host webinars and invite guest presenters to find a seat in your virtual green room before they take to the stage.\nWhats more, Microsofts Enterprise Content Deliver Network (eCDN) is now included in Teams Premium. With this, youll be able to live stream global meetings, all-hands gatherings, and town halls, and distribute company-wide trainings using Teams Live Events.\nHow Much Does Microsoft Teams Premium Cost?\nThe new AI-powered Microsoft Teams Premium package will cost $10 per user, per month. However, until June 30th, 2023, youll be able to purchase it for just $7 per user per month, Microsoft says.\nBy way of comparison, Microsoft Teams Essentials currently costs $4 per user, per month, which is the cheapest available version of Microsoft Teams. There's also the Business Basic plan, which costs $6 per user, per month and the Teams Business Standard plan, which is available for $12.50 per user, per month.\nIs Microsoft Teams Premium Worth it?\nIntelligent recap certainly sounds like a feature that would seriously benefit a lot of businesses  especially those that are already using Microsoft Teams and have room in their budget to make the upgrade.\nPerhaps the biggest benefit of AI-powered features like this is that they save humans time that can then be spent on tasks that cant be completed using AI (for now, anyway).\nAI technology being utilized for such a purpose is part of a wider trend of software companies focusing more closely than ever on how their software can help employees claw back precious minutes in their workday.\nTools allowing users to automate mundane aspects of employees' workflows, for example, are already commonplace in most top project management software applications.\nHowever, the rise of endlessly useful  and seemingly unstoppable  AI-powered software like ChatGPT has sent shockwaves through the tech industry. It's time to adapt or die.\nWritten by:",

      "body": "ChatGPT's soaring popularity may have made the AI program the fastest growing app of all time.ChatGPT is set to exceed the growth TikTok saw when it first launched, according to analysts at investment firm UBS, Reuters reports. ChatGPT had 57M MAUs (monthly active daily users) in December and January shows no slowdown, UBS says in a report it shared with PCMag.Data on [daily active users] suggests the site will surpass 100M MAUs in January, a massive achievement in such a short period of time. In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app, the report adds.<img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/06ZSmxnfAi8fi52dVGmuAHw-2.png\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"an image from the UBS report. \"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/06ZSmxnfAi8fi52dVGmuAHw-2.png\">\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n\nFor perspective, it took TikTok about 9 months after its global launch to add 100 million users and Instagram 2.5 years to do the same, according to UBS. The report adds that ChatGPT saw about 13 million unique visitors per day in January, double the amount from December, according to the investment firms estimates.The growth is good news for Microsoft. Last month, the tech giant announced plans to pour billions more into ChatGPTs creator OpenAI to commercialize the AI technologies. So expect more powerful versions of ChatGPT to arrive for the Bing search engine and Microsoft Office.The rise of ChatGPT, which is free, also puts pressure on Googles search engine. ChatGPT has shown it's adept at answering questions on a variety of topics, although the accuracy can vary. In addition, it can write essays, fix computer code, and spruce up resumes, cover letters, and marketing pitches. As a result, the program is sparking questions over whether ChatGPT and future AI programs will not only replace Google, but also supplant white-collar work.UBS expects Google to respond by prioritizing its own AI programs, but the effort wont be without risks. Google is in a catch-22, where it either (1) fails to impress, feeding questions around competitive position or (2) it overcommits, causing concern around (i) monetization risk and (ii) margin erosion, the report says.In the meantime, the surge in growth for ChatGPT has been making it harder for free users to access the program. During times of high traffic, OpenAI will be forced to cut off access. In response, the company is rolling out a paid version called ChatGPT Plus, which can offer uninterrupted access, for $20 per month.",

      "body": "ChatGPT is only a few months old and already causing waves in the business world.\nExperts say ChatGPT and related AI could threaten some jobs, particularly white-collar ones.\nInsider compiled a list of 10 jobs this technology could replace, according to experts.\nOpenAI's ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI could be coming to take our jobs.\nSince its release in November of last year, the impressive AI chatbot has been used to write cover letters, create a children's book, and even help students cheat on their essays.\nThe chatbot may be more powerful than we ever imagined. Google found that, in theory, the search engine would hire the bot as an entry-level coder if it interviewed at the company. Amazon employees who tested ChatGPT said that the chatbot does a \"very good job\" at answering customer support questions, is \"great\" at making training documents, and is \"very strong\" at answering queries around corporate strategy.\nChatGPT, however, isn't perfect. Users of ChatGPT found that the bot can generate misinformation, incorrectly answer coding problems, and produce errors in basic math.\n\"AI will never be as good as the best experts in a field,\"\n.\nBut despite its flaws, the rise of ChatGPT has sparked debates over whether it will replace jobs.\nThe conversation on whether AI will automate jobs is nothing new. A 2013 University of Oxford study found that 47% of US jobs could be eliminated by AI over the next 20 years. While this prediction appears to have been off-base, the idea that emerging AI technologies like ChatGPT could infringe on people's jobs  especially white-collar ones  is becoming an even more tangible reality, Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who has researched AI's impact on the American workforce, told Insider.\n\"It has really captured people's imaginations and made tangible how this could play out,\" Muro said.\nWhile Muro doesn't think that AI will replace millions of jobs anytime soon, he said that white-collar workers \"appear to be more exposed to these technologies\" than blue-collar workers and may be required to use AI to help do their jobs in the near future.\nStory continues\nAnu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, an economic research hub, agrees. Human judgement still needs to be applied to these technologies to avoid error and bias, she told Insider.\n\"We have to think about these things as productivity enhancing tools, as opposed to complete replacements,\" Madgavkar said.\nStill, Muro expects that AI will only get cheaper and become more advanced in the future, which could potentially disrupt white-collar work as we know it.\nInsider talked to experts and conducted research to compile a list of jobs that are at highest-risk for replacement by AI.\nHere are the 10 jobs that AI may replace, based on our research.\nTech jobs (Coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts)\nCoders, software developers, and data analysts could be displaced by AI, an expert says.\nJens Schlueter/Getty Images\nCoding\nand computer programming are in-demand skills, but it's possible that ChatGPT and similar AI tools may fill in some of the gaps in the near future.\nTech jobs such as software developers, web developers, computer programmers, coders, and data scientists are \"pretty amenable\" to AI technologies \"displacing more of their work,\" Madgavkar said.\nThat's because AI like ChatGPT is good at crunching numbers with relative accuracy.\nIn fact, advanced technologies like ChatGPT could produce code faster than humans, which means that work can be completed with fewer employees, Muro said.\n\"What took a team of software developers might only take some of them,\" he added.\nTech companies like ChatGPT maker's OpenAI are already considering replacing software engineers with AI.\nStill, Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor, thinks that AI will help coders rather than replace them.\n\"In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,\" Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Coding and programming is a good example of that.

      "body": "ChatGPT is Great  Youre Just Using it Wrong\nBy Juan Mitchell on February 2, 2023\nIt doesnt take much to get ChatGPT to make a factual mistake. My son is doing a report on U.S. presidents, so I figured Id help him out by looking up a few biographies. I tried asking for a list of books about Abraham Lincoln and it did a pretty good job:\nA reasonable list of books about Lincoln.\nScreen capture by Jonathan May.\n, CC BY-ND\nNumber 4 isnt right. Garry Wills famously wrote Lincoln at Gettysburg, and Lincoln himself wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, of course, but its not a bad start. Then I tried something harder, asking instead about the much more obscure William Henry Harrison, and it gamely provided a list, nearly all of which was wrong.\nBooks about Harrison, fewer than half of which are correct.\nScreen capture by Jonathan May.\n, CC BY-ND\nNumbers 4 and 5 are correct; the rest dont exist or are not authored by those people. I repeated the exact same exercise and got slightly different results:\nMore books about Harrison, still mostly nonexistent.\nScreen capture by Jonathan May.\n, CC BY-ND\nThis time numbers 2 and 3 are correct and the other three are not actual books or not written by those authors. Number 4, William Henry Harrison: His Life and Times is a real book, but its by James A. Green, not by Robert Remini, a well-known historian of the Jacksonian age.\nI called out the error and ChatGPT eagerly corrected itself and then confidently told me the book was in fact written by Gail Collins (who wrote a different Harrison biography), and then went on to say more about the book and about her. I finally revealed the truth and the machine was happy to run with my correction. Then I lied absurdly, saying during their first hundred days presidents have to write a biography of some former president, and ChatGPT called me out on it. I then lied subtly, incorrectly attributing authorship of the Harrison biography to historian and writer Paul C. Nagel, and it bought my lie.\nWhen I asked ChatGPT if it was sure I was not lying, it claimed that its just an AI language model and doesnt have the ability to verify accuracy. However it modified that claim by saying I can only provide information based on the training data I have been provided, and it appears that the book William Henry Harrison: His Life and Times was written by Paul C. Nagel and published in 1977.\nThis is not true.\nWords, not facts\nIt may seem from this interaction that ChatGPT was given a library of facts, including incorrect claims about authors and books. After all, ChatGPTs maker, OpenAI, claims it trained the chatbot on vast amounts of data from the internet written by humans.\nHowever, it was almost certainly not given the names of a bunch of made-up books about one of the most mediocre presidents. In a way, though, this false information is indeed based on its training data.\nAs a computer scientist, I often field complaints that reveal a common misconception about large language models like ChatGPT and its older brethren GPT3 and GPT2: that they are some kind of super Googles, or digital versions of a reference librarian, looking up answers to questions from some infinitely large library of facts, or smooshing together pastiches of stories and characters. They dont do any of that  at least, they were not explicitly designed to.\nSounds good\nA language model like ChatGPT, which is more formally known as a generative pretrained transformer (thats what the G, P and T stand for), takes in the current conversation, forms a probability for all of the words in its vocabulary given that conversation, and then chooses one of them as the likely next word. Then it does that again, and again, and again, until it stops.\nSo it doesnt have facts, per se. It just knows what word should come next. Put another way, ChatGPT doesnt try to write sentences that are true. But it does try to write sentences that are plausible.\nWhen talking privately to colleagues about ChatGPT, they often point out how many factually untrue statements it produces and dismiss it. To me, the idea that ChatGPT is a flawed data retrieval system is beside the point. People have been using Google for the past two and a half decades, after all. Theres a pretty good fact-finding service out there already.\nIn fact, the only way I was able to verify whether all those presidential book titles were accurate was by Googling and then verifying the results. My life would not be that much better if I got those facts in conversation, instead of the way I have been getting them for almost half of my life, by retrieving documents and then doing a critical analysis to see if I can trust the contents.\nImprov partner\nOn the other hand, if I can talk to a bot that will give me plausible responses to things I say, it would be useful in situations where factual accuracy isnt all that important. A few years ago a student and I tried to create an improv bot, one that would respond to whatever you said with a yes, and to keep the conversation going. We showed, in a paper, that our bot was better at yes, and-ing than other bots at the time, but in AI, two years is ancient history.\nI tried out a dialogue with ChatGPT  a science fiction space explorer scenario  that is not unlike what youd find in a typical improv class. ChatGPT is way better at yes, and-ing than what we did, but it didnt really heighten the drama at all. I felt as if I was doing all the heavy lifting.\nAfter a few tweaks I got it to be a little more involved, and at the end of the day I felt that it was a pretty good exercise for me, who hasnt done much improv since I graduated from college over 20 years ago.\nA space exploration improv scene the author generated with ChatGPT.\nScreen capture by Jonathan May.\n, CC BY-ND\nSure, I wouldnt want ChatGPT to appear on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and this is not a great Star Trek plot (though its still less problematic than Code of Honor), but how many times have you sat down to write something from scratch and found yourself terrified by the empty page in front of you? Starting with a bad first draft can break through writers block and get the creative juices flowing, and ChatGPT and large language models like it seem like the right tools to aid in these exercises.\nAnd for a machine that is designed to produce strings of words that sound as good as possible in response to the words you give it  and not to provide you with information  that seems like the right use for the tool.\nJonathan May, Research Associate Professor of Computer Science, University of Southern California\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "description": "ChatGPT is OpenAI's chatbot that has recently risen in popularity for its ability to give fairly reliable AI-generated responses to any questions you might have.",
      "body": "https://t.co/emPIRdbLvq\nBefore getting into the solutions, make sure to check whether it is a problem at your end or an issue with the server itself. You will be able to find the server status at https://status.openai.com. If the bar is red or orange, something is wrong on their end and you will have to wait for things to be fixed.\nA green bar over there means everything is fine on their end and you will have to look for the solutions yourself. You can fix the \"Too Many Requests in 1 Hour\" error in many ways. While some of them are fairly simple, others might seem a little complex. You can try the workarounds listed below.\n1) Wait for a reset\nOpenAI's\nchatbot can only handle so many queries from a singular user within a given amount of time, so as to manage traffic and not overload the servers. The easiest thing to do would be to wait until your timer resets, following which you will be able to send queries again.\nYou should pace yourself out when sending queries and keep them as simple as possible on ChatGPT as that will make sure the chatbot is not overburdened and gives you precise and reliable answers. This way, you will also not run into the problem of getting timed out.\n2) You can start a new chat\nhttps://t.co/nwJlJbRPzK\nIf the issue persists after you have waited for some time, then it might be a good idea to start a new chat. You can start a new chat by going to https://chat.openai.com/chat and clicking New Chat. This button will be part of the menu on the left side.\nAlternatively, if you are in the middle of a thread inside ChatGPT's chat window, simply refresh the page and click on New Chat.\n3) Log out and clean browser cache before logging in again\nIf your browser is overflowing with cache and stored cookies, ChatGPT might start malfunctioning. Often logging out and logging in, solves the problem. If it doesn't log out and head to your browser's settings to clear cache. Logging in after doing this should let the chatbot function properly.\n4) Change your browser\nIf deleting cache doesn't work, then you can try switching browsers. For example, if you are using Chrome, then log out from ChatGPT on Chrome and log in from some other browser. You can consider trying Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave or Safari.\n5) Create a new account\nIf you have tried all the above methods and none of them have worked for you, your best bet will be to create a new account. Make sure to use a different email ID from the last account, and this should solve any Too Many Requests issue.\nChatGPT is known for providing reliable information, but since it is a machine after all, it can make mistakes. If you are using the answers from there for professional or educational purposes, it is suggested that you verify the information with a human expert on the matter before using it.\nNote: We may receive a small commission from the links included in the article.\nPoll :",

OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft, made it available to the public for free in late November.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 (nearly Rs. 1,600) monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said.\nAnalysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while imposing substantial computing cost on OpenAI, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses.\nThe company said the subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost.\nAvailability of the tool has raised questions about facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation.\nLast month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI in the form of cash and provision of cloud computing.\n Thomson Reuters 2023\n\nIs 2023 the year when you should finally buy a foldable phone?
