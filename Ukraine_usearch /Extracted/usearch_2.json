The move comes ahead of a meeting of European leaders in kyiv to discuss Ukraine's path towards EU membership.                \n                    \n                    Among the targets of Wednesday's coordinated searches were residences linked to influential billionaire Igor Kolomoisky and former Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.  Law enforcement also raided tax offices in the capital and senior customs officials were fired, Zelensky's party chief David Arakhamia said. These are the latest in a series of high-level efforts to combat corruption in recent weeks.  In the midst of a war with Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has upped the ante in the internal fight against corruption, vowing to make as many personnel changes \"as necessary,\" including at the highest positions. \"People in government who do not meet the basic requirements of the state and society should not take their seats,\" he said in a video address on Tuesday.  Zelensky was elected in 2019 on an anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform.  However, ongoing efforts to crack down on misconduct have been overshadowed by the Russian invasion nearly a year ago.Ukraine currently ranks low 116 out of 180 countries on the list of perceived corruption, according to anti-corruption group Transparency International.billion dollar fraud Investigators from the Ukrainian security service SBU released images of a search at the home of Kolomoisky, who was barred from entering the United States on allegations of corruption and undermining democracy. Before the Russian invasion, Kolomoisky was one of the richest men in the country, with holdings in a number of industries, including the media, aviation and energy. The security service stated that the search had been launched following an investigation into the embezzlement of 40 billion hryvnia (about $1.1 billion) from energy holdings.Last week, the Ukrainian authorities fired a dozen senior officials, including defense officials and a top adviser in the president's office. One of them was the former Deputy Defense Minister, Viacheslav Shapovalov, who worked in logistical support for the Army.  The Ministry has been accused of signing food contracts at prices up to three times higher than those of the market. The SBU also said it had uncovered a scheme by the head of kyiv's tax office involving \"multi-million dollar\" fraud.  They accuse the official of having abused a position of authority. In addition, the government has seized stakes in energy companies - oil producer Ukrnafta and refiner Ukrtatnafta - as part of moves to consolidate the war effort. More layoffs are possible.  The State Bureau of Investigation and the Attorney General's Office said Wednesday that they had informed several senior officials that they were being investigated for crimes including embezzlement of state funds and misuse of state property. \"Any criminal who has the audacity to harm Ukraine, especially in wartime conditions, must clearly understand that we will put handcuffs on him,\" Vasyl Maliuk, head of the SBU, said Wednesday.speed vs.  integrityRenewed efforts to tackle corruption are believed to be aimed at appeasing EU leaders, who arrived in kyiv on Thursday for a summit to discuss Ukraine's EU bid. According to Brussels, the strengthening of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and the reduction of the influence of powerful oligarchs are essential conditions for accession. \"Ukraine wants to show that it can put together a stable government capable of negotiating and demonstrating the value systems and commitment to transparency necessary to be part of the EU,\" says Melanie Garson, Associate Professor of International Security and Conflict Resolution at the University of Ukraine. College of London (UK). However, among the EU Member States there are very divergent views on the speed of the process.  Ukraine's staunchest supporters - including Poland and the Baltics - insist that kyiv is making big strides against corruption and that progress could be faster than anticipated.  But others insist that while making Ukraine a candidate country is the proper token of support in light of the war, the process of the major reforms needed will be long and arduous. \"The EU must find a balance between speed and integrity,\" says Joel Reland, a research associate at UK in a Changing Europe.  \"It is clear that it wants Ukraine to join on the fast track but, at the same time, it cannot fully compromise its accession principles, which define the integrity of the EU.\" Even so, French President Emmanuel Macron warned last May that it could take \"decades\" before Ukraine meets the criteria and achieves full membership.The advantage Meanwhile, demonstrating issues like transparency is not just a matter of values. In 2016, then-US Vice President Joe Biden withheld loan guarantees to Ukraine until the country's attorney general, Viktor Shokin, was ousted as part of a push for coordinated anti-corruption reforms at the State Department. with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. In 2023, countries providing crucial military and financial aid to Ukraine still have \"the upper hand in forcing their position,\" says Garson, an associate professor of International Security and Conflict Resolution.  \"Zelenski is well aware of this and is trying to reiterate more bipartisan support around the world.\" Although the public removal of personalities - including a high defense official - in the middle of war may seem like a risk, not tackling corruption in wartime can have even more serious consequences in the long term.   Funding for reconstruction and recovery efforts can be \"drastically undermined by criminals pocketing funds, both during and after war,\" Transparency International states in its 2023 annual report. \"The visibility that work has been done to make this a place where donors don't feel like their funds are going into the pockets of oligarchs is really important,\" adds Garson.  \"There has to be trust in the government funds coming in and in outside investors - it's critical for long-term strategic rebuilding.\" *With AFP;  adapted from its original in English  \n                                            \n    \n                  \r\n#Ukraine #launches #wave #anticorruption #raids #ahead #summit"

    "body": "Thursday 2 February 2023 - 21:18\nLong-range Arms Supplied to Kiev Should Be Moved Away from Russia: Lavrov\nStory Code : 1039245\nIslam Times - Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the more long-range weapons are supplied to the Kiev regime by the West, the further they must be moved away from Russia's borders.\nIn an interview with Sputnik, he underscored that the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine is growing.\n\"The fact that the West cannot calm down - and, as in the infamous fairy tales, with every step it gets stuck even more in the swamp - this plays an important role in the course of the [Russian special military] operation. This escalation, you are absolutely right, is snowballing, Lavrov said.\nHe added that \"now we are trying to move the Ukrainian army's artillery so that it cannot pose a threat to our borders, but the West is going to supply long-range weapons, which means we will have to move it further.\"\nThe top Russian diplomat stressed that everybody wants the conflict in Ukraine to end, but the time factor is not the main one.\n\"We all want this to end, but it is not the time factor that is important here, the essence factor is of importance, the factor of the quality of the results that we provide for our people, for those who want to remain part of the Russian culture,\" Lavrov underlined.\nAccording to Lavrov, the West is trying to defeat Russia in such a way so that it could not recover for decades, which is an attempt to solve the Russian issue.\nWhy do people refuse to see the Nazi ideology that now underlies the Kiev regime? All those statements that are being made by his supporters and puppet masters, well, I don't see any way to regard them otherwise as an attempt to finally solve the Russian issue.\nHe added that it seems that the West will supply Kiev with modern military equipment together with foreign combat crews.\n\"All types of weapons that have already been partially transferred, and especially those that have been announced, according to experts, it is impossible for Ukrainians to work on these systems, trained or having passed some two-month or even three-month courses. There are systems, according to specialists, that cannot be trained for in the foreseeable future, and if they are supplied, then most likely it will be done together with combat crews,\" Lavrov noted.\nThe Russian foreign minister also said that Moscow did not turn to Collective Security Treaty Organization [CSTO] partners with a request for assistance in connection with Russias special military operation in Ukraine.\n\"We have not made such a request to anyone. We proceed from the fact that we have everything necessary to solve the tasks of the special military operation, to end the war that the West started through the Ukrainian regime even after the coup dtat,\" he underlined.\nThe remarks come after German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius last month announced Berlins decision to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, something that was followed by US President Joe Biden saying that Washington will deliver 31 Abrams tanks to Kiev.\nMoscow has repeatedly warned that the US and its allies sending military aid to Kiev adds to prolonging the Ukrainian conflict. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that NATO countries play with fire\" by supplying weapons to Kiev, and that any convoy of arms for Ukraine will become a legitimate target for Russian forces.\nShare It :"

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has leveraged a World War II commemoration to whip up support for his army&#39;s offensive in Ukraine, comparing the fighting to Nazi Germany&#39;s invasion and hinting Moscow could use nuclear weapons.Arriving in the southern city of Volgograd for commemorations to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, achieved at enormous cost, Putin on Thursday sought to boost support for his assault on Ukraine.He compared Russia&#39;s so-called &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine to the war against Nazi Germany in 1941-1945 and claimed Russians were ready to go &quot;until the end.&quot;&quot;Again and again we are forced to repel the aggression of the collective West,&quot; Putin said in the city on the Volga River formerly known as Stalingrad.&quot;We aren&#39;t sending tanks to their borders but we have something to respond with, and it won&#39;t be just about using armoured vehicles. Everyone should understand this,&quot; he added.&quot;A modern war with Russia will be completely different,&quot; he said.Since sending troops to pro-Western Ukraine last February Putin has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against the West if the conflict escalates.&quot;It&#39;s unbelievable but true. We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks.&quot;&#39;To go until the end&#39;&nbsp;&quot;Readiness to go until the end, to do the impossible for the sake of the motherland, for the sake of truth was &mdash; and is &mdash; in the blood, in the character of our multinational people,&quot; said Putin.He spoke after laying flowers at the city&#39;s legendary landmark &mdash; a hilltop memorial to the battle that includes the towering 85-metre sculpture of a woman with a raised sword known as &quot;The Motherland Calls&quot;.The commemorations in the southern Russian city come as the Kremlin looks to step up its offensive in Ukraine, bolstered by tens of thousands of reservists mobilised last autumn.The 1942-43 Battle of Stalingrad raged for nearly six months and when it was over the city was in ruins and more than a million soldiers and civilians had lost their lives.The Red Army&#39;s victory marked a turning point not only for the Soviet Union, which had suffered several heavy defeats, but also for the Allied forces.Bust of StalinOn the eve of Putin&#39;s arrival, a bust of dictator Joseph Stalin was unveiled in Volgograd.Since Putin took power in Russia in 2000, a growing chorus of Russians are taking a positive view of the Stalin&#39;s role in history, and analysts have pointed to the creeping rehabilitation of Stalin in the country.Nostalgic for the superpower status of the USSR, many Russian officials have been promoting Stalin as a tough leader who led the Soviet Union to victory in World War II and presided over the country&#39;s industrialisation.The Soviet Union lost an estimated 20 million people in World War II and the legacy of what is known in the country as the Great Patriotic War is venerated.Officials declared Wednesday and Thursday public holidays in Volgograd following a request from war veterans.The city was renamed Volgograd in 1961, eight years after the death of Stalin.Since 2013, the city is temporarily renamed Stalingrad several times a year, including on February 2 and on May 9, when Russia holds nationwide celebrations on the anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II."

Kay Nietfeld/dpaAt the summit in Kyiv, Ukraine's accession to the EU will also be an issue.  Gring-Eckardt, Vice President of the Bundestag, insists on membership. Kyiv - It is the first EU summit in a war zone.  Ukraine is hoping for new aid commitments from a visit by top EU representatives to Kyiv planned for Friday (February 3, 2023).  \"We expect news for Ukraine,\" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  The intended accession to the European Union is one of the topics at an EU-Ukraine summit tomorrow in Kyiv.Ukraine has officially been a candidate for EU membership since last June.  The summit is also likely to deal with further military and civilian aid for Ukraine.  Bundestag Vice President Katrin Gring-Eckardt (Greens), who is already in Kyiv, emphasizes the relevance of EU membership for Ukraine and hopes for a clear announcement.Summit meeting in Kyiv: Gring-Eckardt emphasizes the relevance of the EU perspective for UkraineThe European perspective is important for Ukraine.  It is bringing about concrete progress, already now.  Once the formal criteria are met, Ukraine should also officially be a member of the EU.  We should do everything we can to ensure that the country succeeds,\" Gring-Eckardt said in an interview with ZDF.The European perspective is important for Ukraine because it brings concrete progress.  Gring-Eckardt insists on early membership and tweeted: \"As soon as the formal criteria are met, Ukraine should also be an official member of the EU.  We should do everything we can to ensure that the country succeeds in this. The process would take time, as certain requirements also had to be met.  But a clear announcement that Ukraine is on the way to membership is necessary from the point of view of the Green politician.EU accession of Ukraine  Gring-Eckardt: Ukraine belongs to the European familyIn addition, Gring-Eckardt emphasizes that Ukraine is part of the European family.  The country must be helped to meet the requirements for joining the EU, she told the Deutschlandfunk.

In the meantime, there are also consequences, for example when cases of corruption are uncovered.  Ukrainian investigators carried out raids again yesterday, including on a former minister and an oligarch. EU summit meeting in Kyiv: Bundestag Vice President hopes for quick tank deliveryRegarding further support for Ukraine, Gring-Eckardt advocates Germany's help in training soldiers.  \"We should do what we can, what we are capable of and what we are particularly good at,\" said the Bundestag Vice President in an interview with the ZDF. She also endorses the tank deliveries.  Chancellor Olaf Scholz released the Leopard 2 tanks in Kyiv after a long hesitation.  However, this is also linked to the hope \"that the tanks will arrive very soon\" because there is great concern about a major Russian offensive, according to Gring-Eckardt.

Instead, they could compete under a neutral flag.\nThat view has been challenged in recent days by two Ukrainian medalists at the Tokyo Olympics, tennis player Elina Svitolina and high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, and by boxer Wladimir Klitschko, who took gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. They want a total ban on Russia and Belarus from Paris.\nOlympic officials in Ukraine have warned they could boycott Paris and are meeting Friday to discuss it.\nIt is extremely regretful to escalate this discussion with a threat of a boycott at this premature stage, the IOC said Thursday.\nOlympic officials in Latvia and Poland are also threatening a boycott, and those countries were joined by Estonia and Lithuania in a statement Thursday by sports ministers which suggested the sports debate was being used as a distraction from the illegal aggression against Ukraine.\nIt is natural that there are dissenting voices coming mainly from neighboring countries of Ukraine, given their specific situation, said the IOC, whose Olympic Charter obliges the 206 national Olympic bodies to send a team to the Summer Games.\nAt the White House on Thursday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States had worked to hold Russia accountable for the brutal and barbaric war before acknowledging the IOCs position.\nIn cases where sports organizations and event organizers, such as the International Olympic Committee, choose to permit athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in sporting events, it should be absolutely clear that they are not representing the Russian or Belarusian states, she said.\nThe IOC also responded to the comparison with Apartheid-era South Africa being excluded from the Olympics for more than 20 years, noting that U.N. sanctions were in place then and also when athletes from the former Yugoslavia competed as independent neutrals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\nThere are no U.N. sanctions in place against Russia and Belarus at this moment in time, the IOC said.\nRussia, as a permanent member of the U.N Security Council, can veto any of its proposed resolutions.\nThe IOC also pointed to having created an aid fund of $7.5 million that is helping more than 3,000 Ukrainian athletes.\nThe IOC is deeply saddened to hear of the death of members of the Olympic Community in Ukraine who have lost their lives in this war, it said.\nGovernment pressure on athletes and sports bodies should also be resisted, the IOC said, adding its stated mission is to unite the entire world in a peaceful competition.\nUltimately, the governing bodies of each Olympic sport should decide the conditions for athletes to be able to compete in Paris.\n___\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

    "body": "Washington, Feb 3 (AP) After months of agonizing, the U.S has agreed to send longer-range bombs to Ukraine as it prepares to launch a spring offensive to retake territory Russia captured last year, U.S. officials said Thursday, confirming that the new weapons will have roughly double the range of any other offensive weapon provided by America. The U.S. will provide ground-launched small diameter bombs as part of a $2.17 billion aid package it is expected to announce Friday, several U.S. officials said. The package also for the first time includes equipment to connect all the different air defense systems Western allies have rushed to the battlefield and integrate them into Kviv's own air defenses, to help them better defend against Russia's continued missile attacks. Also Read | China Says US Must Show Some Sincerity, Actually Do Something To Help Sri Lanka. For months, U.S. officials have hesitated to send longer-range systems to Ukraine out of concern that they would be used to target inside Russia, escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. deeper in. The longer-range bombs are the latest advanced system, such as Abrams tanks and the Patriot missile defense system, that the U.S. has eventually agreed to provide Ukraine after initially saying no. U.S. officials, though, have continued to reject Ukraine's requests for fighter jets. Ukrainian leaders have urgently pressed for longer-range munitions and on Thursday, officials said the U.S. will send an undisclosed number of the ground-launched, small diameter bombs, which have a range of about 95 miles (150 kilometers). The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the aid package not yet made public. Also Read | Taliban Welcomes Indian Budget 2023-24, Says 'Will Help Improve Ties Between Nations'. To date, the longest-range missile provided by the U.S. is about 50 miles (80 kilometers). The funding in the aid package is for longer-term purchases, so it wasn't clear Thursday how long it will take to get the bomb to the battlefield in Ukraine. Ukraine's defense minister Oleskii Reznikov said Thursday the country is prepared to offer guarantees to its Western partners that their weapons won't be used to strike inside Russian territory, adding that Kyiv needs weapons with the range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) to expel the Russian forces. &amp;#8220;If we could strike at a distance of up to 300 kilometers, the Russian army wouldn't be able to mount a defense and will have to withdraw,&amp;#8221; Reznikov said at a meeting with EU officials. &amp;#8220;Ukraine is ready to provide any guarantees that your weapons will not be involved in attacks on the Russian territory. We have enough targets in the occupied areas of Ukraine, and we're prepared to coordinate on (these) targets with our partners,&amp;#8221; the minister said. The U.S. aid package includes $425 million in ammunition and support equipment that will be pulled from existing Pentagon stockpiles and $1.75 billion in new funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to purchase new weapons from industry. The USAI, which will pay for the longer-range bombs and the air defense system integration, also funds two HAWK air defense systems, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, and counter-drone systems. Since Russia's invasion last February, Western allies have pledged a myriad of air defense systems to Ukraine to bolster Kyiv's own Soviet-made S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems, and the latest aid package aims to provide the capability to integrate them all, which could improve Ukraine's ability to protect itself against incoming Russian attacks. The U.S. has pledged medium- to long-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, and truck-launched short-range Avenger air defense systems; the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. are sending Patriot missile defense systems; Germany is sending medium-range IRIS-T air defense systems; and Spain is sending Aspide anti-aircraft air defense systems. The addition of longer-range bombs into the latest aid package was first reported by Reuters. Ukraine is still seeking F-16 fighter jets, which U.S. President Joe Biden has opposed sending since the beginning of the war. Asked Monday if his administration was considering sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, Biden responded, &amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221; On Tuesday, Ukraine's defense minister Oleksii Reznikov was asked if Biden's ''no&amp;#8221; to F-16s was the final word. &amp;#8220;All types of help first passed through the no' stage,&amp;#8221; Reznikov said. &amp;#8220;Which only means no' at today's given moment. The second stage is, Let's talk and study technical possibilities.' The third stage is, Let's get your personnel trained.' And the fourth stage is the transfer (of equipment).&amp;#8221; (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)"

    "body": "Oil-rich Norway says it will use the massive oil and gas profits it benefited from as a result of Russias war on Ukraine to help finance aid, including military assistance, for Kyiv. Speaking from Oslo on Thursday, Norwegian Prime Minister Gahr Stre said it was in Norways national interest to ensure that Ukraine does not lose the war with Russia, and Norway is in a situation where we have room for action due to extraordinary income from the petroleum sector.The prime minister was referring to Norways skyrocketing earnings, which saw the country enjoy a 200% year-on-year increase in estimated tax revenue from the oil and gas industry. For 2022, the Norwegian Tax Administration estimated that the government took in $89.3 billion, beating its last record by three times, Reuters reported.  In October, Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor announced record third-quarter profits, achieving $24.3 billion in the July-September period, and over $9.77 billion in the same period of 2021. Equinor is scheduled to report Q4 earnings on February 8th.  These surging profits have led to criticism across Europe that the country has benefited from war profits while others are struggling.  Related Everybody Loves Oil Again  Most European countries are getting poorer because of the war. Norway is getting richer  much richer, Lars-Henrik Paarup Michelsen, director of the Norwegian Climate Foundation think tank, told CNBC.Next week, the Norwegian government will provide more details on exactly how the countrys oil revenues will be used to aid Ukraine. Norwegians will be concerned that spending oil revenues from the $1.3-trillion sovereign wealth fund on Ukraine could fuel higher inflation; however, the prime minister has assured his constituents that there will be no negative economic impact. The announcement comes just days after Norways sovereign wealth fund reported a record loss of $164 billion for 2022 due to very unusual market conditions that resulted in losses in all sectors invested in outside of oil and gas.  The Labor-led government has sought to trim spending of the oil fund to avoid fueling price growth which remains near a three-decade high, and has raised taxes on the wealthy while also introducing new resource taxes on its fish-farming industry. The use of fossil-fuel wealth on the aid package will not stoke the Norwegian economy nor feed higher inflation in the country, according to the prime minister.  European officials have urged Norway to share its windfall export gains from higher fossil fuel prices.  The premiers comments suggest the plan will not involve procurement from Norways defense companies that include Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and Nammo AS. The country, which also shares a border with Russia, last year provided military and civil aid totaling more than NOK 10bn USD 1bn to Ukraine.  By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com"
