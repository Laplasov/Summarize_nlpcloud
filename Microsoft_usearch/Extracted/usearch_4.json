In terms of global layoffs, the company recently laid off over 10,000 employees and joined forces with other technology giants. Despite global economic tensions, the company has laid off approximately 5% of its workforce. Notably, this is one of the biggest job cuts made by the company. We saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, and now were seeing them optimise their digital spend to do more with less, says the company.

    "body": "Ravie Lakshmanan\nEnterprise Security / Authentication\nMicrosoft on Tuesday said it took steps to disable fake Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) accounts that were used for creating malicious OAuth applications as part of a phishing campaign designed to breach organizations' cloud environments and steal email.\n\"The applications created by these fraudulent actors were then used in a consent phishing campaign, which tricked users into granting permissions to the fraudulent apps,\" the tech giant said. \"This phishing campaign targeted a subset of customers primarily based in the U.K. and Ireland.\"\nConsent phishing is a social engineering attack wherein users are tricked into granting permissions to malicious cloud applications, which can then be weaponized to gain access to legitimate cloud services and sensitive user data.\nThe Windows maker said it became aware of the campaign on December 15, 2022. It has since alerted affected customers via email, with the company noting that the threat actors abused the consent to exfiltrate mailboxes.\nOn top of that, Microsoft said it implemented additional security measures to improve the vetting process associated with the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program (formerly MPN) and minimize the potential for fraudulent behavior in the future.\nThe disclosure coincides with a report released by Proofpoint about how threat actors have successfully exploited Microsoft's \"\nverified publisher\n\" status to infiltrate the cloud environments of organizations.\nWhat's notable about the campaign is that by mimicking popular brands, it was also successful at fooling Microsoft in order to gain the blue verified badge. \"The actor used fraudulent partner accounts to add a verified publisher to OAuth app registrations they created in Azure AD,\" the company explained.\nThese attacks, which were first observed on December 6, 2022, employed lookalike versions of legitimate apps like Zoom to deceive targets into authorizing access and facilitate data theft. Targets included financial, marketing, managers, and senior executives.\nProofpoint noted the malicious OAuth apps had \"far-reaching delegated permissions\" such as reading emails, adjusting mailbox settings, and gaining access to files and other data connected to the user's account.\nIt also said that unlike a previous campaign that compromised existing Microsoft verified publishers to take advantage of OAuth app privileges, the latest attacks are designed to impersonate legitimate publishers to become verified and distribute the rogue apps.\nTwo of the apps in question were named \"Single Sign-on (SSO),\" while the third app was called \"Meeting\" in an attempt to masquerade as video conferencing software. All three apps, created by three different publishers, targeted the same companies and leveraged the same attacker-controlled infrastructure.\n\"The potential impact to organizations includes compromised user accounts, data exfiltration, brand abuse of impersonated organizations, business email compromise (BEC) fraud, and mailbox abuse,\" the enterprise security firm said.\nThe campaign is said to have come to a close on December 27, 2022, a week after Proofpoint informed Microsoft of the attack on December 20 and the apps were disabled.\nThe findings demonstrate the sophistication that has gone into mounting the attack, not to mention bypass Microsoft's security protections and misuse the trust users place in enterprise vendors and service providers.\nThis is not the first time bogus OAuth apps have been used to target Microsoft's cloud services. In January 2022, Proofpoint detailed another threat activity dubbed OiVaVoii that targeted high-level executives to seize control of their accounts.\nThen in September 2022, Microsoft revealed that it dismantled an attack that made use of rogue OAuth applications deployed on compromised cloud tenants to ultimately takeover Exchange servers and distribute spam.\nFound this article interesting?

    "body": "Microsoft Corp. says its going to keep making new games in the popular Halo franchise at its prized 343 Industries studio  despite rumors to the contrary. But after a leadership overhaul, mass layoffs and a host of big changes, the outfit is all but starting from scratch.The Redmond, Washington-based 343 Industries released its latest game, Halo Infinite, in December 2021 to widespread critical acclaim. It was seen as a redemption story for a title that suffered multiple delays, endless development problems and a merry-go-round of creative leads. But in the months that followed, fans turned against the game, complaining about a thin road map and the slow rollout of features that had been expected on day one. At the same time, 343 was seemingly losing staff by the week and went through a major leadership change last fall that led some employees to brace for a reorganization.  The ax fell in mid-January when Microsoft announced mass layoffs and 343 Industries was hit hard. While Microsoft declined to provide specific figures, at least 95 people at the company have lost their jobs, according to a spreadsheet of affected employees reviewed by Bloomberg. The list named dozens of veterans including top directors and contractors, upon which the studio heavily relies. Those temporary employees were given just a few days warning before their contracts came to an end, according to people familiar with the process, asking not to be identified because they werent authorized to speak publicly.    The cuts led to rumors that 343 would farm out development of the Halo series to other game companies. Matt Booty, head of Microsofts Xbox Game Studios, said in an interview that 343 will continue as the internal developer for Halo and as the home of Halo. Internally, Booty has assured 343 staff that even as they work with outside partners and outsourcing houses, they will remain in charge. Questions remain, however, about the fate of the Halo franchise as the studio is hollowed out and makes big changes to how it develops games.    Chief among them is a pivot to a new gaming engine, the suite of tools and technology used to make video games. The studios own engine, known publicly as Slipspace, has been one of the biggest points of contention over the past two decades. Based largely on old code from the 1990s and early 2000s, its buggy and difficult to use and has been the source of headaches for some developers on Halo Infinite, people familiar with the development said. Several multiplayer modes that are nearly finished, such as Extraction and Assault, both popular in previous Halo games, have yet to be released in part because of issues involving the engine, they said.  At several points over the past decade, management at 343 debated switching to Epic Games Inc.s popular Unreal Engine. But it wasnt until late last year, when previous studio head Bonnie Ross and engine lead David Berger departed and Pierre Hintze took over, that the firm finally decided to pivot to Unreal. This switch will start with a new game code-named Tatanka, according to people familiar with the plans. That project, which 343 is developing alongside the Austin, Texas-based game studio Certain Affinity, started off as a battle royale but may evolve in different directions, the people said. Future games in the series will also explore using the Unreal Engine, which may make development easier, although internal skeptics are worried that the switch may have a negative impact on the way Halo games feel to play. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on issues with the engine or on the companys plans to pivot to Unreal.  Since Halo Infinite was released, fans had assumed that in addition to new multiplayer modes, 343 was working on new content for the story. But that wasnt the case, according to the people familiar with the situation. Developers were making prototypes in the Unreal Engine and pitching ideas for new Halo games rather than working on new missions for Halo Infinite. Many of those developers were laid off this month and the company isnt actively working on new story content, the people said. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.In the eyes of some observers and former 343 employees, the reorganization was a long time coming. The studio, which was founded in 2007 to inherit Halo after Microsoft parted ways with original developer Bungie, has struggled through many challenges, including the release of several polarizing games. Patrick Wren, a former 343 designer, said on Twitter that the job cuts and the state of the Halo franchise overall are the result of incompetent leadership up top during Halo Infinites development that led to massive stress on those working hard to make Halo the best it can be.  Microsoft once promised that Halo Infinite would be the start of the next ten years for Halo, but its recent moves point to a shorter-term vision. In an email to staff following the layoffs, Hintze wrote that the current plan for 343 is to support a robust live offering for Halo Infinite and its Forge level creator and greenlighting our new tech stack for future Halo games while also bringing Halo to more players through more platforms than ever before.  s"

    "body": "Timothy Geigner\nIf you havent been living under a rock for the past couple of years, you will be familiar with the concept of the anti-woke culture war the Republican Party grows and farms for its own purposes. This isnt to say there arent real cultural conflicts we need to work out as a country, but that doesnt change the simple fact that much of what you hear about in the press is specifically cultivated by one party or another to generate headlines and outrage for the purposes of votes and campaign contributions.\nAnd if youre looking for an avatar for this sort of un-principled outrage manufacturing, Ted Cruz would be one of the first names I would bring up. Cruz claims to be a strict constitutionalist, while also threatening companies for exercising their free speech rights. In most of the cases, Cruz is railing against the woke in favor of shit-peddling lie-factories like OAN, claiming that a company choosing what to do within its own private purview is somehow censorship in favor of wokeism.\nAnd it gets really dumb at times. You may have heard recently that the GOP was out there claiming that the White House was going to be coming to collect not your guns (this time), but your gas-powered ovens/stoves. It wasnt really true. What actually happened was a consumer safety group within the government pointed out that there were a lot of health risks with these ovens and that the group might seek to lower future production of them in favor of safer electric ovens. No jackbooted thugs were going to go house to house and haul away your grandmothers gas stove.\nBut then came Cruz also going after Microsoft. Why Microsoft? Well, because Microsoft had embraced wokeism, according to Cruz, by updating its standard Xbox power settings to be more power efficient. Yes. Yes, really.\nHeres what Microsofts Xbox update actually does: It will cut down on power usage by up to a factor of 20 by changing the default setting of Xbox consoles from sleep to shut down.\nwave of stories from Fox News\nand the like. According to them, not only was Xbox going woke by making these environmentally friendly changes, butFox and Friendshosts Ainsley Earhardt and Jimmy Failla suggested Microsoft was trying to recruit your kids into climate politics.\nThe open question appears to be: if this is wokeism, which its not, then that doesnt explain what in the world is wrong with any of this. What, specifically, is Cruz objecting to here? The end customer is barely going to notice any difference other than a slightly longer boot time. The only other differences he or she might notice is a lower electricity bill, a longer-lasting Xbox console, and maybe the air outside is just a little bit less polluted. Where is there a problem to rail against here?\nBut the idea behind a manufactured culture war is to make good use of the echo chamber, which is exactly what happened next.\nBut again, whats the point of video games? Its for kids to be kids, Faila suggested in a\nTuesdayFox and Friendssegment\nabout Microsofts Xbox plans. Now you sit down and pick up a controller and theyre like by the way, the world is on fire, AHH. You know what I mean? You just want to play the game!\nAnd you can. That hasnt changed. The console doesnt tell you the world is on fire. The console doesnt open to a splash screen requiring you to donate to Black Lives Matter before you start your game. It just you know starts up and plays your game.\nSo please, whatever your political leanings, dont fall for this stuff. Cruz knows better, but hes trying to take advantage of you. Dont let him.\nFiled Under: energy, energy saving, power saving, ted cruz, woke,"

While the hike announcement is currently limited to the country, it might be a hint that the same will happen to other western markets in the coming weeks. (via\nGematsu\n)\nThis hike will put the Xbox Series X price, which currently costs 54,978 yen, to 59,978 yen. That translates to $422 to $460, which means a $38 increase. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S will increase from 32,278 yen to 37,978 yen or $248 to $292, an additional $44.\nMicrosoft Japan already informed the customers about the price increase of the said consoles.\nAfter carefully evaluating the market condition in Japan, we have decided to change the suggested retail price of Xbox consoles in the country, Microsoft Japan explained. We regularly evaluate the impact of local pricing to maintain reasonable consistency across regions. This price revision affects our customers and was a difficult decision to make, but going forward we will continue to provide the ultimate Xbox experience that our customers expect.\nThe news is no surprise since Xbox Lead Phil Spencer himself\nadmitted\nit in October, expressing the companys need to look at the return on our business, the cost of the business.\nWeve held price on consoles, and held price on games, and our subscription. I dont think well be able to do that forever. Spencer said at that time. I do think that at some point, well have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday, we thought it was really important to maintain the prices that we have because consumers, right now, are more uncertain than they have been in a long time.\nPrior to this, Microsoft had already\nconfirmed\nhigher prices on its first-party games, causing the titles like Forza Motorsport, Redfall, and Starfield to charge $69.99 instead of the usual $59.99.\nWeve held on price increases until after the holidays so families can enjoy the gift of gaming. Starting in 2023 our new, built for next-gen, full-priced games, including Forza Motorsport, Redfall, and Starfield, will launch at $69.99 USD on all platforms, said Microsoft, explaining the decision.

    "body": "Microsoft will be removing a bunch of beloved games from the Xbox 360 Marketplace on February 7th, according to a support page on the Xbox website (via Wario64), meaning you wont be able to buy them after that date.\n\nIts not all bad news. If youve already bought a game thats getting pulled, you can still download it after February 7th. Games being removed that are available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S stores will remain purchasable on those platforms.\n\nBut that does mean digital games only available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace will be unavailable for purchase in just a week. Users on Resetera have figured out which games fall into that category and will be going away for good, and the list includes some well-known titles like Jet Set Radio, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, Spelunky, and The Orange Box.\n\nThe games leaving the Xbox 360 Marketplace varies based on your region, and you can see which titles are being pulled by checking Microsofts site. Heres the full list for the US.\n\nWhen asked about the removals, Microsoft shared these statements from Xbox global product marketing manager Bree Adams with The Verge:\n\n> Beginning on February 7, 2023, a limited set of games, add-ons, and in-game content will no longer be purchasable in select markets via the Xbox 360 Store. These titles will no longer be purchasable on the Xbox 360 Store only, and titles that are available to be purchased on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S Stores will remain purchasable. You will still be able to play discs or previously downloaded games on your Xbox 360 and modern consoles if they are backwards compatible titles. For more information on the games impacted in your region, visithere.\n> Impacted Xbox 360 titles purchased before February 7, 2023 will be available to redownload via your previously purchased content through the Xbox 360 Download Historyhere.\n\nUnfortunately, losing the ability to purchase older digital video games is becoming something of a regular occurrence. Nintendo will be closing the eShop on Wii U and 3DS in less than two months. Microsoft has previously delisted several Forza titles. And in late 2021, Sony made it much harder to shop on the PS3 and Vita stores.\n\nWhile its disappointing that you dont have much time to make a choice about buying these disappearing Xbox 360 titles, at least we know when theyll be going away. So if youve been wavering on finally picking up The Orange Box on Xbox, make sure you get it before February 7th."

Now, a quick peek at the Microsoft Build website's page source has revealed the potential date.\n, the date \"May 23-25, 2023\" can be seen when checking the page source on the Microsoft Build website, giving us a solid reason to think that's the date Microsoft Build 2023 will be held.\nThe current live version of the\nMicrosoft Build website\n(opens in new tab)\nwas just recently updated to say the following: \"Thank you for your interest in Microsoft Build.We're getting ready to launch registration - check back soon!\" This just suggest that Microsoft is almost ready to announce dates for the event.\nOf course, the dates spotted in the page source could simply be a placeholder until Microsoft has an actual date locked in, but considering last year's Build conference took place on May 24-26, we think May 23-25 for Build 2023 is a likely candidate. This would have the event run from Tuesday to Thursday.\nIf you check the page source for https://t.co/vDigeHYISm Then MS Build 2023 will take place between May 23rd and 25th https://t.co/qftdq3kGba pic.twitter.com/RKY8aTiZix\nJanuary 31, 2023\nSee more\nIt's currently unclear if Build 2023 will be a hybrid digital and in-person event like last year, or if the company plans to return to an all-digital event for this year. In-person attendance was limited in 2022, with many opting to tune into the event digitally instead.\nMicrosoft Build is where Microsoft often announces new features for developers, including updates to the Windows App SDK, Microsoft 365, and more. Unfortunately, Microsoft rarely talks about new Windows features at Build these days, though that doesn't mean they couldn't start doing so now we know Windows 11 is being developed on a \"continuous innovation\" release schedule.\nWindows Central Newsletter"

    "body": "(CC0)\nThe January patching window for your firm has probably come and gone. But has it? While January included a huge release of patches, several releases in other months have provided more than one headache for the patch management community. These are the patches and updates you need to evaluate if you havent already done so.\nBitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\nIn January, additional information came out about CVE-2022-41099, the BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability. If youve already deployed the November or later security updates to your network and have done nothing else, you arent done with the evaluation of this update.\nFirst, you need to determine your risk level. For this attack to be successful, the attacker needs physical access to your computer. There is much less risk for devices that have physical security and are locked or stored securely. If you have disabled the Windows Recovery Environment (WindRE) partition because you have alternative means to recover and reimage your devices, you are also not at risk. If you are somewhere in the middle youll need to determine if you need to take action.\nPatching is not enough. You must also apply the applicable Windows security update to your WinRE. Besides disabling the recovery partition, you could also use a GitHub script to update the WinRE for this vulnerability and ensure it is patched appropriately. Additional discussions describe the potential for additional attack sequences, but it appears at this point to be an attack sequence that leads us back to theoretical attacks rather than proven attack sequences as well as remembering the long-standing Immutable Law of Security #3: If a bad actor has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.\nKerberos hardening updates\nMany administrators are still evaluating the impact of the November Kerberos hardening updates. Any patch installed on your domain controller that includes the November or later updates will have potential impact on your domain. To be proactive the following is recommended:\nFirst, determine if these updates will impact your domain. A PowerShell script is available to detect potential authentication issues that may occur in an Active Directory (AD) domain after installing these updates. As noted, Run the script in PowerShell with domain administrator privileges from a machine with AD RSAT tools installed, such as on a domain controller. The script will output any detected compatibility issues found in the domain related to changes made for CVE-2022-37966.\nAs noted in a Microsoft blog, the November updates caused issues with authentication, and Microsoft released an out-of-band update to fix the issue. Many patching administrators skipped over both the November and December updates waiting for issues to shake out.\nNext, if you cant remember the last time your organization changed the password to the Kerberos account (Krbtgt account), then you are long overdue to run this script to do so. There are various modes for the script, and its recommended to run it in this order:\nMode 1: Informational mode (no changes at all)\nMode 8: Create TEST KrbTgt accounts\nMode 2: Simulation mode (temporary canary object created, no password reset)\nMode 3: Simulation mode -- Use KrbTgt TEST/BOGUS accounts (password will be reset once)\nMode 4: Real reset mode -- Use KrbTgt PROD/REAL accounts (password will be reset once)\nMode 9: Cleanup TEST KrbTgt accounts (could be skipped to reuse accounts the next time)\nIts recommended to change the Krbtgt password twice, waiting 24 hours between each change before changing it the second time. This is also the recommended process if you have a compromised Active Directory. Its also recommended to reset all administrator and service account passwords twice.\nIf you only reset the password once:\nAfter first reset, the new KRBTGT password replicates to all the DCs in the domain.\nAll new tickets will use the new password (KRB1).\nOld tickets issued by old KRBTGT password (KRBOLD) should continue to work as password history is 2.\nPost old tickets expiry they should renew tickets with new KRBTGT password (KRB1).\nPresent KRBTGT passwords will be KRB1 and KRBOLD.\nWhen you reset the password twice, wait for 24 hours to pass:\nAfter second reset new KRBTGT password replicates to all the DCs in the domain.\nAll new tickets will use the new password (KRB2).\nOld tickets issued by old KRBTGT password (KRB1) should continue to work as password history is 2.\nPresent KRBTGT passwords will be KRB1 and KRB2.\nPost old tickets expiry they should renew tickets with new KRBTGT password (KRB2).\nOld KRBTGT password (KTB old) not valid anymore as password history is of 2.\nThese Kerberos updates are only in audit mode now and will be enforced later. The December 13 updates have added auditing events. If you are not seeing any such events in your event logs, you should be able to implement the hardening mode in advance by setting the KrbtgtFullPacSignature registry setting or waiting for the enforcement phases. As Microsoft notes, in July 2023 the default setting will be enforced.\nYou want to look for events now before the new settings are enforced. To do so, open the system event log and filter as follows:\nSusan Bradley\nWhile not enforced at this time, the impact on legacy systems should be investigated. You may need to have your team open support cases to discuss the impact and options with Microsoft. After this patch is enforced, all legacy operating systems will fail to authenticate via Kerberos.\nThe impact of these two patching-related issues is not immediate. You have time for your team to investigate. Dont wait too long or expect Microsoft to roll back the impact on these two patches. Both are certain to create more work for your BitLocker and AD teams.\nNext read this"

Reed Albergotti said that it is not just ChatGPT from OpenAI that is being added to Bing Search but a faster and richer version named GPT-4.\nThe report. The report says, The most interesting improvement in the latest version described by sources is GPT-4s speed. Right now, it can take a while  sometimes minutes in my experience  for ChatGPT to answer.\nCurrently, ChatGPT, which runs off GPT-3.5, feels slow and can take minutes to output the result. The replies generated through GPT-4 reportedly sound more human and are more detailed, the report says.\nGPT-4. GPT-4, which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4, is a neural network created by OpenAI. It is the next version of GPT-3.5, which is currently used by ChatGPT.\nAs a reminder, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022. It is built on OpenAIs GPT-3.5 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.\nChatGPT uses content across the web from before 2021 to teach itself how to answer questions, but when it comes to recent and trending topics, it has difficulty.

OpenAI, the platform's developer, announced on its official blog that it's launching a pilot subscription plan called ChatGPT plus. Users who pay $20 per month will receive general and unfettered access to ChatGPT, even at peak times.

The tech giant is a key investor in OpenAI, having provided three rounds of investment into its business. The company has been coy about how much it's spent and whether this gives it an ownership stake of any meaningful size.\nRegardless, it's clear that AI is one of Microsoft's many ambitions.
