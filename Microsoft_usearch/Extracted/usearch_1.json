What is considered the most expensive deal for the company and the video game industry has yet to close, due to opposition from the FTC and regulators.  The company has not moved forward in this purchase agreement for a long time and the news that we bring is that the EU just sent to Microsoft his list of concerns about the deal to buy Activision Blizzard.\nIn mid-January 2022, Microsoft shocked the world by announcing that they were going to buy Activision Blizzard and King.  If this deal went through, it would have some of the most successful video game studios in its possession.  And it is that, they would become part of Microsoft sagas of games such as call of duty, Overwatch, Devil, WoW either Candy Crush.  Microsoft planned to close the deal as soon as summer 2023 at the latest, but is in too much trouble to meet this date.\nMicrosoft receives a letter with EU concerns about Activision\nThe history of Microsoft and Activision Blizzard is long and extensive, but we can summarize that to this day, the agreement is still standing and Microsoft has not managed to make changes.  It continues to have enemies galore, where we would position the American FTC as the most problematic of all.  This was the one that blocked the deal and made the desperate decision to sue the company to prevent the EU from negotiating with it.  Not that Europe is really allied with Microsoft, but we do know that Europe was willing to have talks with the company about the deal.\nEverything seemed to be going well and it could be an opportunity for Microsoft, but there is one player that we have ignored so far, Sony.  And it is that, a few days ago, the PlayStation CEO stayed with the boss EU antitrust to talk about the Activision deal.  We do not expect anything good from here and now we bring news, well Microsoft has received a letter from the EU.  In this they have declared their concerns regarding the Activision Blizzard purchase agreement.\nThe deadline to make decisions is April 11\nIt was last Tuesday when Microsoft received the letter from the EU and although the content is not known of it, if we know that time is pressing.  And it is that, the antitrust investigation against the software giant will end soon and a deadline has been set to make decisions, the next April 11.  With this list of EU concerns, we can only wonder what it contains, since it may be that among them is a path to follow and that allows the purchase from Activision by Microsoft.\nSo that, the European Commission has not yet decided to block the acquisition of the company, although it does request a series of changes, conditions and solutions from Microsoft.  In the event that these are not met, of course he will be in charge of prohibiting the agreement.  Although for the purchase to finally be completed, Microsoft needs the approval from 16 jurisdictionsso this is still far from over."

Theres also been long-standing rumours of a Gears Of War remaster collection, which matches with the idea The Collations other game was a smaller project.\n\n\n\nThe cancellations are supposedly a consequence of the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft and while Grubb claims that The Coalition was only affected a little bit it seems as if Microsoft is tightening its belt anyway.\n\n\n\nThe studio is now going to move on fully to Gears 6, said Grubb in a Twitch stream. I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but definitely, that will be their next game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same podcast, Grubb also talked about Insomniacs Wolverine game, stating that it will be a hard R  a reference to American age ratings for movies and implying the game will be extremely gory.\n\n\n\nThats been suggested before but there continues to be confusion as to when the game will be released, with some sources claiming its years away and others suggesting it will be much sooner.\n\n\n\nAccording to Grubb it could be out as early as autumn 2024, although it might easily slip into 2025. Given how secretive Sony has been with Spider-Man 2 though that doesnt guarantee itll be shown this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Insomniacs Wolverine game is a 2023 release says Microsoft?\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Gears Of War remaster collection rumoured for June reveal and 2022 release\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Gears Of War 6 developer working on new IP but not Star Wars claims insider\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.uk\n\n\n\nFor more stories like this,check our Gaming page."

In 2022, investors put at least $1.37 billion into generative AI startups, usually at the seed stage. That's almost as much as what was invested in the market in the previous five years combined, according to PitchBook.\nBut the surest sign yet that ChatGPT is setting the pace and defining the tech industry for at least the next year is OpenAI's blockbuster, $10 billion partnership with Microsoft to bring the AI into products like the Bing search engine and Microsoft Office. Indeed, Microsoft is wasting no time, already launching an OpenAI-powered chat transcription and task-suggestion service for its Microsoft Teams app.\n\"Microsoft is set to work alongside OpenAI to create a game-changing technology fully integrated into MSFT over the next decade,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. \"Nadella is not going to repeat the same mistakes and we believe this strategic investment is a smart poker move in this AI arms race that is taking place globally.\"\nWhich is to say that while it remains to be seen how exactly this technology will transform our lives in the coming months, experts are convinced that ChatGPT and technology like it is here to stay  not some passing fad.\n\"We predict we're on the brink of the next platform shift: The knowledge and information economy will be defined by artificial intelligence,\" VCs at Bessemer Venture Partners wrote in a recent blog post.\nWhy this iteration of ChatGPT made generative AI so popular right now\nIt's important to note that nothing about ChatGPT or generative AI is especially new or novel. As Facebook's lead AI scientist Yann LeCun noted recently, \"It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public. It's just that it's well put together, it's nicely done.\"\nIn other words, OpenAI's real innovation was taking AI technology that was already out there and making it something that was easy and accessible to anybody.\n\"The way they've created the user interface and the way that they've exposed the technology in such a useful way and allowing it to be casual or formal  there's a lot of engineering that they did that is really special that has allowed the technology to really shine,\" said Matt Mead, the CTO at tech modernization firm SPR.\nAs the underlying technology becomes more accessible to developers, we'll see a host of new tools come up that change the way we work, search for information, and interact with services like healthcare, the experts said. Combined with the increasing availability of computing power, and developments in AI itself, there's a new generation of startups just poised to be born.\n\"As we've been able to improve the architecture, prices of chips and compute are decreasing and getting more efficient over time, we're able to build models with much more data and there's a confluence of vectors of progress that's all happening at the same time,\" said Talia Goldberg, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI is just the beginning of what's possible with generative AI\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI offers some hints about where the technology can go from here. For one, it is poised to disrupt is the search experience.\nRight now when we search for information in Google we get multiple options back and can pick what we think is the most accurate. However, when you ask ChatGPT something, it comes back with a specific answer. Microsoft hasn't been able to break Google's lead in search, but with the AI technology its Bing search engine could actually compete.\nIt's something VCs are watching closely as they choose which companies to invest in, Goldberg said.\nMicrosoft is \"positioned to try and deliver a really radically different and transformative search experience, and compete on a different vector now relative to Google,\" she said. \"and then there's a host of other companies that we think are doing really interesting things.\"\nBeyond search, Microsoft's plans around its investment in OpenAI has experts thinking about how they'll sell this tech beyond integrating the technology across its products like Excel, Azure, and its subsidiary GitHub's AI-powered Copilot programming assistant. Some analysts also see an opportunity to offer it as a cloud service that other companies can buy and use, similar to how cloud infrastructure services are sold.\nThat's one reason why there will be a lot more business uses for generative AI technology than consumer use cases in the near term, said Mark Shmulik, a Bernstein analyst.\nFor example, ChatGPT has the potential to disrupt the way people code and how engineering teams are run because it can take less engineers to write code. ChatGPT for example can generate the basic code that actual engineers use and customize to get to an end product, he said.\nAnother example could be an opportunity to use it in the advertising industry to bypass some of the work done by large expensive ad agencies, Shmulik said.\nUltimately, there's much more we're going to see with this technology, and Microsoft may have gotten ahead with its OpenAI partnership but many other players are catching up, experts said.\n\"Microsoft has been early and very public with their relationship with OpenAI,\" Goldberg said. \"But they will certainly not be the only large player to be involved with the emerging startup ecosystem here.\"\nGot a tip?Contact this reporter via email at\nor Signal at 925-364-4258.

Considering that the original \"Ark Survival Evolved\" is available on the Epic Games Store, it won't be surprising that \"Ark 2\" might be released for the platform as well. Still, no confirmation about that option has been made so far, according to Rockpapershotgun.com.\"Ark 2\" is a \"console launch exclusive\" for the Xbox Series X, which means that it will only be available to the current-gen Microsoft console at launch. However, the wording also seems to suggest that the game might be coming to other consoles as well once this exclusivity period expires.This leads to the question PlayStation gamers have been asking  is \"Ark 2\" coming to the PS5 console after the exclusivity period with Microsoft ends? At this point, there is no confirmation from Studio Wildcard, but it is certainly a possibility, considering that the first Ark game became a hit on the PS4 console.'Ark 2' story, charactersWhile \"Ark 2\" will definitely have an \"epic story,\" details are still a bit scarce for now.

Here's how to do get a refund from Microsoft, and what you need to do to get that cash back.\n\n\n\nAmong all the store owners, there's nothing more difficult than getting a refund from console manufacturers. Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo were dragged along with the rest of the industry to provide some method of refund. \n\n\n\nThankfully, unlike the other two, Microsoft and the Xbox refund process is pretty simple. The only issue here is that Microsoft isn't very open with its requirements. \n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\nAs we're suspecting they're similar to the enforcement set on Steam by various government bodies around the world, here's what you need to know about Xbox refunds:\n\n\n\n\nMust be under the 14 days since purchase\n\n\n\nMust have a non-significant amount of time played\n\n\n\n\nThe first is fine, but the \"non-significant amount of time\" is the sticking point. On Steam, it is no more than two hours of game time, so let's stick with that. \n\n\n\nHow to refund games on Xbox\n\n\n\nHead to Microsoft's dedicated page first. On this page, you will need to sign into your Xbox account. It will display a list of your eligible games to refund. \n\n\n\nDLC and in-game purchases might not be eligible for a refund. \n\n\n\nClick through any on-screen instructions, and you'll be able to track your refund through this page.\n\n\n\nRefund not available on Xbox\n\n\n\nIf your game isn't available in the list, it means it doesn't match the requirements set by Microsoft. If this is the case, there's not much else to do. Those EULA and various agreements you clicked through is your sticking point here. \n\n\n\nTo get through them, you'd have to begin contacting Microsoft to sort out your situation, however, we don't think this would result in much change.\n\n\n\nGetting money back for digital purchases is a headache and we can't offer much more advice outside of this. \n\n\n\nRefund Fortnite V-Bucks on Xbox\n\n\n\nOn the chance you have a child that has bought multiple Fortnite things, you might need to go through Epic Games to sort that side of things out. \n\n\n\nThe FTC did rule on Fortnite refunds, so it might be worth reading up on that too."

The generative AI model is expected to take a massive leap with the introduction of GPT-4, which will succeed the currently utilised GPT-3 autoregressive language model. The update is reportedly being integrated into Microsoft's applications, with the tech giant's search engine, Bing, among the platforms that are set to benefit from the development.\nMicrosoft\nrecently announced a multi-million-dollar investment in ChatGPT's parent firm, OpenAI, in a move that could help it overtake Alphabet's Google as the most preferred search engine in the world. The tech giant has already announced integration of the ChatGPT chatbot into its workplace instant messaging platform, Microsoft Teams, through a premium subscription model priced at $7 (roughly Rs. 600).\nAccording to a Semafor report, the upcoming GPT-4 system could be integrated into Microsoft's search engine, Bing. GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer, or the ability of an AI-model to parse through humungous data sets, and generate comprehensive answers to queries in a way that mimics human language.\nBaidu Working on a ChatGPT-Style AI Chatbot, Will Launch Soon\nThe most important upgrade that GPT-4 will bring over GPT-3, is the speed at which it can respond to queries, as per the report. This is being done through improved input datasets, algorithms, parameterisation, and alignment, rather than just making the language model larger and vaster. The majority of work is reportedly being done on the server side, through optimisation tweaks that make the system more efficient, accurate, and faster.\nChatGPT, is currently free for all users to test as part of an ongoing public beta. On Wednesday, OpenAI also launched a pilot subscription model  ChatGPT Plus  priced at $20 per month (roughly Rs. 1,650). This is mostly due to the fact that running the system does come at a cost, with each search costing OpenAI a couple of cents according to CEO Sam Altman.\nThe process is currently powered by supercomputers co-developed by Microsoft and OpenAI that has 285,000 CPU cores and 10,000 GPUs which have a 400Gbps network connectivity speed, as per the report.\nChatGPT's Creator Releases 'Imperfect' Tool to Identify AI-Generated Text\nWith the source code that ChatGPT is built on open for all, developers have been rushing to get their hands on Nvidia's latest graphics processor, the H100 Tensor Core GPU, which is best suited to run systems like those used in GPT. Nvidia's H100 Tensor Core GPU costs $30,000 (roughly Rs.25,00,00) which makes this a rather expensive affair, to say the least.\nTherefore, much of the race towards domination of the search engine market could be led by AI-powered generative models like GPT, and by the innovation on the server side of these models, in particular.\nBeware ChatGPT Trying to Teach Your Kids Math  or Anything\nGoogle has enjoyed the pole position ever since it beat Yahoo several years ago, to become the world's most preferred search engine. It remains to be seen if Microsoft's Bing will end up challenging and overthrowing Google as the world's most popular and widely used search engine.\n5G is now available both on Android and iPhone in India.

The price is available for the entire term of the initial subscription (except for some month-to-month and some three-year annual billed monthly subscriptions). The offer ends on June 30, 2023, when it returns to the standard $10 per month per user, as it's been promoted since launching in preview last October.\nMicrosoft 365 and Office 365 licenses, such as E3 and E5, are a requisite to the Teams Premium subscription. Microsoft's recent survey of 4,500 workers found a strong demand for AI tools to automate mundane tasks, so it might be Teams users pressuring employers to purchase the subscription.\nAlso:\nHow to get started using ChatGPT\nMicrosoft says Teams Premium obviates the need for third-party add-on products that some professionals buy to enhance webinars, virtual appointments, and meeting intelligence.\nIntelligent recap has so far been the headline description for the AI features of Teams Premium, but Microsoft has now detailed more capabilities that public experimentation with ChatGPT online has demonstrated, from answering complex questions to writing essays, solving coding questions, and generating questions a university professor would use.\nTeams Premium's AI-generated chapters divides PowerPoint Live meeting recordings into sections. For Teams itself, intelligent recap does this job based on meeting transcripts.\nPersonalized timeline markers help with catching up on missed meeting minutes by marking out when the user joined or left. It will also eventually mark where the user's name was mentioned, when a screen was shared, who spoke at a meeting, and when the user spoke during a meeting.\nGPT-3.5 also underpins Teams Premium AI-generated notes, which creates key points and takeaways captured during a meeting. The idea is that users can focus on the meeting rather than taking notes.\nAs Microsoft has previously stated, intelligent recap capabilities won't be available until the second quarter of 2023.\nMicrosoft's\n$10 billion investment in OpenAI\nhas helped revamp its messaging around workers wanting AI in products, including Microsoft 365/Office 365, Azure, and GitHub's Codex-powered pair programming tool, Copilot. Microsoft chief Satya Nadella said last month that Microsoft will \"incorporate AI in every layer of the stack\" across productivity and consumer services.\nMicrosoft is reportedly testing ChatGPT to answer some Bing questions to challenge Google in search. Google is also reportedly testing in-house answers to ChatGPT for Google Search.\nMore AI features in Teams Premium that will be available in mid-February include live translations, branded meetings, organization backgrounds, organization together mode scenes, and meeting template for IT admins. Other features include advanced meeting protection, watermarking content to deter leaks, and limits on who can record.\nAlso:\nWhat is ChatGPT and why does it matter? Here's everything you need to know\nTeams Virtual Appointments has been in preview since October and enables external attendees to join a branded virtual lobby room via a message.\nMicrosoft this month reported it had seen \"strong interest\" in Teams Premium. The company is looking at subscriptions like this to boost revenues as cloud revenues growth (including Azure and Office 365) slows and Windows OEM revenues decline. This shift comes as Teams user number growth slows, too.\nTeams now has 280 million monthly active users, up from 270 million monthly active users it reported in January 2022.

The use of malvertising to surface links leading to various first-stage malware that eventually deliver ransomware or other payloads is one of the most common.\nIn 2022, the most popular ransomware payloads were LockBit Black, BlackCat/ALPHV, Vice Society, Black Basta, Play, and Royal, says Microsoft.

    "body": "Kenrick Cai\nIN\nan unremarkable conference room inside OpenAIs office, insulated from the mid-January rain pelting San Francisco, company president Greg Brockman surveys the energy levels of the team overseeing the companys new artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT. How are we doing between everythings on fire and everyones burned out to everyones just back from the holidays and everythings good? Whats the spectrum? he asks.\nI would say the holidays came at just the right time, replies one lieutenant. Thats an understatement. Within five days of ChatGPTs November launch, 1 million users overloaded its servers with trivia questions, poetry prompts and recipe requests. (Forbes estimates its now 5 millionplus.) Open-AI quietly routed some of the load to its training supercomputer, thousands of interconnected graphics processing units (GPUs) custom-built with allies Microsoft and Nvidia, while long-term work on its next models, like the highly anticipated GPT-4, took a back seat.\nAs the group huddles, ChatGPTs at-capacity servers still turn away users. The previous day, it went down for two hours. Yet amid the fatigue, this roomful of employees, all in their twenties and early thirties, clearly relish their roles in a historic moment. AI is going to be debated as the hottest topic of 2023. And you know what? Thats appropriate, says Bill Gates, the person most responsible for a similar previous paradigm shiftone known as software. This is every bit as important as the PC, as the internet.\nThe markets agree. Valued at $29 billion following a reported $10 billion investment commitment from Microsoft, OpenAIspecifically, Brockman, 34, and his boss, CEO Sam Altman, 37serves as the poster child for something extraordinary. But its hardly alone. In image generation, Amazon quietly backs Stability AI (recent value: $1 billion), whose brash CEO, Emad Mostaque, 39, aspires to be the Amazon Web Services of the category. Hugging Face ($2 billion) supplies tools for giants like Intel and Meta to build and run competitive models themselves. Below the generative AI providers in this budding tech stack, Scale AI ($7.3 billion) and others provide picks-and-shovels infrastructure; above them, an ecosystem of applications develops, funneling the AI into specialized software that could fundamentally alter jobs for lawyers, salespeople, doctorspretty much everyone.\nIs there hype? Plenty. The reported valuation for OpenAI, aggressively forecasting 2023 revenue of $200 million (compared to expected revenue of about $30 million last year, according to part of a past investor presentation observed by Forbes), would imply a forward 145 price-to-sales multiple, compared to a more typical 10x or 20x. (OpenAI declined to comment on its financials except to say that the investment was multiyear and multibillion.) No matter that AI insurgents arent pure disruptorsAmazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and others already profit by providing the cloud infrastructure underpinning much of the category. Google in particular, with its enormous resources and decade-plus of machine learning research, is the elephant in the room, says investor Mike Volpi at Index Ventures.\nSocietal challenges? Those too. Theres potential for bias and discrimination in the models, not to mention misuse by bad actors. Legal spats are emerging over the ownership of AI-generated work and the actual data used to teach them. Then theres the ultimate goal that some, such as Open-AIs leaders, envision: a conscious, self-improving artificial general intelligence that could reimagine capitalism (Altmans hope)or threaten humanity (others fear, including Elon Musks).\nTodays AI-based image generators arent self aware. But Forbes asked OpenAIs DALL-E and Stability AIs Stable Diffusion  to attempt to visualize themselves, using an identical prompt: an artistic portrait of the artificial intelligence called X, created by the artificial intelligence X. These were the authors favorites of the resulting self-portrait attempts.\nDreamStudio / DALL-E\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman declined to be photographed for this story. Heres how his generative AI tool DALL-E imagined Sam Altman on the cover of Forbes Magazine  in this generated image, proudly presenting it himself.\nDALL-E\nBut in speaking with more than 60 researchers, investors and entrepreneurs in the category, its clear that this AI gold rush also has something other recent crazes have lacked: practical, even boring, business substance. The race to embed tools in company workflows, large and small, is already on. Calls to AI-based code snippets, or APIs, soared tenfold in 2022, with more acceleration in December, according to provider RapidAPI. A recent Cowen study of 100-plus enterprise software buyers found that AI has emerged as the top spending priority among emerging technologies. Chat-GPT and Open-AIs models are coming to Microsofts massive-footprint suite of products such as Outlook and Word, with most business software makers poised to follow suit quickly.\nA quarter-century after IBMs Deep Blue program defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, the shift to artificial intelligence is finally here. Its an exciting time, the press-shy Altman tells Forbes, but my hope is that its still extremely early.\nNew York Citys Public School System banned Chatgpt, and a Wharton Professor who tested the program gave it a B on his final exam.\nT\nhis AI tipping point also has roots in London, the headquarters for Mostaques Stability. In August, hot on the heels of the beta launch of OpenAIs image model, DALL-E, Mostaque released Stable Diffusion, which allows anyone to instantly spin a line of text into a piece of art, or turn a dull selfie into a dramatic self-portrait. Unlike OpenAIs proprietary model, Stability doesnt own Stable Diffusion, which is open-source. But its become the biggest driving force and profit-maker behind the project so far. On any given day, 10 million people use Stable Diffusionmore than any other model.\nTHINK BIGGER | At his $2 billion startups January offsite in France, Clem Delangue, Hugging Faces cofounder and  CEO, had one directive for his  150 employees: Be more ambitious. Sometimes when an industry gets bigger, the speed of evolution goes down. Here its evolving really, really fast. I think theres potential for multiple $100 billion companies.\nLevon Biss for Forbes\nSuch rapid adoption proved a turning point. Previously, AI had existed in three realms. The first was academic: A seminal paper demonstrating the power of neural networks, a key underpinning of GPT and other large language models (so named because they can scan, translate and generate text) was published more than a decade ago. The second was demonstrative: Deep Blue created an arms race of stunts, with Alphabets DeepMind unit ultimately creating juggernauts in chess and the ancient board game Go. The third was incremental: apps like Gmail, which works without AI but is better with featur"

These were the authors favorites of the resulting self-portrait attempts.\nDreamStudio / DALL-E\nA\nrtificial intelligence will be 2023s hottest topic, and one subject to debate. Thats what Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates told Forbes in an exclusive conversation about the suddenly exploding field. More than 60 other AI leaders Forbes interviewed share his anticipation: after decades of research and demonstrative stunts like Deep Blues victory over chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, the shift to artificial intelligence is finally here.\nPerhaps nothing indicates this better than OpenAI and its conversational robot ChatGPT. Forbes estimates that its already exceeded 5 million users in less than 60 days from launch. Its usage has become rampant in schools  prompting New York City to ban it on public school computers  and its got enough smarts already to get a B grade on a final exam at Wharton. Soon, it will be deployed in Microsofts Office software suite, and tons of other business applications. But OpenAI nearly shelved ChatGPTs release entirely, its leaders, CEO Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman, told Forbes in rare interviews.\nThen, theres Stability AIs open-source image generation model Stable Diffusion, which has been used on pop music videos, Hollywood movies and by more than 10 million people on a daily basis. Stabilitys brash CEO Emad Mostaque predicts the dot-AI bubble is coming. If OpenAI (recently valued at $29 billion) and Stability ($1 billion, off virtually no revenue) are any indication, its already begun. While the experts Forbes spoke to have different views on how the market will play out, one thing is for sure: soon, AI will be affecting the way that you work, like it or not.\nHere are six things you probably didnt know about ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion and the future of generative AI. For more, read\nForbes new magazine feature on the dawn of the work-ready AI era.\n1. Big Techs last generation of billionaire founders are back in the trenches\nBill Gates is excited about AI, and is now spending 10% of his time back at Microsoft meeting with product teams, he said. Hes not alone: at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly enacted a code red emergency, reorienting the companys work to focus on ways to counteract ChatGPT and similar tools. In turn, hermetic founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are back. Forbes broke the news that Brin filed a code request on LaMDA, Googles natural language chatbot, in January  his first in years.\n2. ChatGPT almost wasnt releasedespite its viral success, ChatGPT did not impress employees inside OpenAI. None of us were that enamored by it,\nForbes\n. None of us were like, This is really useful. This past fall, Altman and co. decided to shelve the chatbot to concentrate on domain-focused alternatives instead. But in November, after those alternatives failed to catch on internally  and as tools like Stable Diffusion caused the AI ecosystem to explode  OpenAI reversed course. It really lit a fire under OpenAI, said Sequoia investor Pat Grady, whose firm bought shares in OpenAI in 2021.\nGreg Brockman, OpenAI's cofounder and president, said that before ChatGPT's launch, he thought the company would be lucky to get \"one Twitter thread of 10,000 likes.\" Its Discord channel alone gained two million members in two months instead.\nCopyright  2022 Ethan Pines\n3. ChatGPT forced OpenAI to delay development on GPT-4\nInternally, ChatGPTs virality has been a double-edged sword. Its instant popularity  more than 1 million users in its first five days  overloaded the companys servers. In the holiday rush, OpenAI employees had to shift computing from its training supercomputer, used to train new models like the highly anticipated GPT-4, to helping run ChatGPT. Stay tuned for follow-up stories that may include an early warning of when GPT-4 is now expected to launch. One thing to know now: according to billionaire Reid Hoffman, who donated to OpenAIs non-profit early on, its developed a sense of humor.\n4. Stabilitys Faustian bargain\nMostaque has positioned his company Stability as the AI company for the people  building the technology in a fashion unlike what he calls the panopticon approach of Big Tech. But hes quietly struck his own arrangement with a tech giant: an incredibly attractive deal with Amazon, which has so far remained a dark horse in the race for AI. The cloud giant provided Stability with more than 4,000 Nvidia GPUs to power Stabilitys supercomputer, one of the worlds largest, on which Stable Diffusion was subsequently trained. Thats a lot of computing power. A year ago, Stability operated just 32 such GPUs, Mostaque said.\n5. Money laundering in the cloud\nBeneath all this flashy new technology lies a bed of lucrative computing infrastructure used to build all the apps. The costs are getting unwieldy  as indicated by OpenAIs reported $10 billion investment commitment from Microsoft, much of which is expected to be spent on computing costs associated with Microsofts cloud service Azure. (Microsoft and OpenAI have called it a multi-year, multi-billion deal.) There is a lack of transparency, said Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, which hosts AI models like Stable Diffusion and was recently valued at $2 billion. It leads to situations where we lose track of the real cloud infrastructure cost of a lot of machine learning. Some of these costs appear to be proliferating unchecked  so much so that Delangue coined his own term for it: Cloud money laundering.\n6. AIs end game?\nArtificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a term for an as-yet hypothetical AI that is conscious, self-improving and theoretically capable of outsripping human control (a prospect that has concerned some, like Elon Musk, an initial donor to OpenAI who has since cut ties with the company). Sam Altman believes we likely wont recognize an AGI when it arrives. This end-game is why OpenAI has two unusual setups for a startup unicorn: a capped-profit mechanism by which, after returning a certain amount of profits to shareholders, it would return to non-profit control; and a merge condition by which, should a competitor get close to reaching an AGI, OpenAI would shut down its own work and fold into the more successful project. Altman also thinks that when an AGI comes  for there could be several  it might break capitalism for the better.\nFor more, read"

The integration allows PS5 owners to join Discord calls by linking accounts and then using the Discord mobile app to transfer calls to the PS5. Sony is also adding Variable Refresh Rate support for 1440p, alongside various dashboard improvements.\nThe Discord voice integration on PS5 appears seems similar to how Microsoft initially launched Discord support on the Xbox. Sony says you have to use the Discord app on your mobile device or computer to get a Discord voice chat going on your PS5 console, which means you wont be able to directly access Discord servers on a PS5 without using a mobile device or your PC to transfer the call.\nHopefully Sony will improve that soon, as Microsoft improved its Discord integration for Xbox in November, allowing Xbox owners join voice channels straight from a console without having to use a phone or PC.\nVRR support at 1440p.\nImage: Sony\nAlongside the Discord support, the PS5 will also get Variable Refresh Rate support for the 1440p resolution. This means compatible HDMI 2.1 displays can enable VRR at 1440p to benefit from smoother visual performance in games.\nSony is also making some improvements to the social aspects of the share screen feature and party chats in the PS5 dashboard, and even adding a new friends who play tile so you can see which friends are currently playing a game.\nSonys new PS5 data transfer tool.\nImage: Sony\nWhile the PS app currently supports auto-upload for screenshots or game clips, youll soon be able to upload game captures manually. Sony is also making it easier to access PS4 saved data on a PS5, meaning new games can load old PS4 saved data. Theres also a new option to move PS5 data and games from one console to another using a local Wi-Fi or LAN connection.\nSony is releasing this new beta software to testers today and well likely see it available on all PS5 consoles in the coming months.\nSign up for the                  newsletter\nVerge Deals"

From the Metaverse to healthcare innovation, Global X has identified some of the top thematic trends to start off the year.\n\nMetaverse & Video Games\nVirtual Reality Immerses Itself in 2023\nMeta Platforms will allocate an estimated 20% of its overall costs and expenses in 2023 to Reality Labs, its virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and Metaverse business.\n1\nIn Q3 2022, Meta allocated 18% of its spending to Reality Labs.\n2\nThe increased investment reflects the companys commitment to developing immersive technologies despite the economic downturn and market volatility that hit big tech particularly hard in 2022. This approach is in line with the rapid innovation seen in the VR and AR space at CES 2023. Many companies debuted exciting new products that push boundaries, including Sony PlayStations VR2 gaming headset, HTCs Vive XR Elite headset, and Lumus Z-lens technology.\nArtificial Intelligence & Cloud Computing\nChatGPT Enters the Cloud\nMicrosoft is looking to invest $10 billion into OpenAI, which would value the emerging leader in artificial intelligence at $29 billion.\n3\nThe deal includes a provision for Microsoft to acquire a 75% share of OpenAIs profits until the investment is recouped, and ultimately, a 49% stake in the company.\n4\nThis move is seen as a strategic one for Microsoft, as the integration of OpenAIs technology, particularly the natural language processing model ChatGPT, could enhance the companys search engine capabilities and challenge the dominance of market leader Google. Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its partnership with OpenAI by making their Azure OpenAI Service available to the public, enabling Azure cloud customers to use OpenAI tools for cloud applications such as Dall-E AI art generation and the GPT-3.5 language system, and even plans to add access to ChatGPT in the near future.\nElectric Vehicles\nGovernment Pumps in Billions for a Cleaner America\nThe U.S. Department of Energy recently secured a significant $2.5 billion loan to Ultium to support the construction of large-scale electric vehicle (EV) lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing plants.\n5\nThis venture is a collaboration between General Motors and LG-Energy Solution and will involve the construction of state-of-the-art facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan, with the possibility of a fourth site in Indiana. The Michigan facility alone is projected to open as early as 2024 and is a key step towards President Bidens goal of achieving 50% of U.S. auto production to be electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by 2030.\n6\nThe commitment to clean transportation extends to the state level, with the California Energy Commission approving a substantial $2.9 billion investment plan to expedite the states goals for electric vehicle charging by 2025.\n7\nThis funding will support the roll-out of thousands of zero-emission trucks, school buses, and transit buses, and is projected to result in the installation of 90,000 EV chargers across the state  significantly surpassing the current number of 80,000.\n8\nCombined with additional funding from utility companies and other programs, these investments are expected to play a pivotal role in California reaching its goal of deploying 250,000 EV chargers by 2025.\nGenomics & Aging Population\nCOVID-19 Victory: Moderna Takes on Cancer\nUtilising the same messenger RNA technology that made their COVID-19 vaccines successful, Moderna created an experimental cancer vaccine that shows promising results in the treatment of melanoma. In a mid-stage trial, the combination of Modernas personalised cancer vaccine and Merck & Co.s highly effective immunotherapy Keytruda resulted in a 44% reduction in the risk of recurrence or death, compared to Keytruda alone.\n9\nSolar Energy & Clean Technology\nSolar Energy Achieves Record Conversion Efficiency\nJinkoSolar, a leading solar module manufacturer, announced a significant development in its N-type monocrystalline silicon tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cell technology. The company achieved a maximum solar conversion efficiency of 26.4%, surpassing its previous record of 26.1% set in October.\n10\nThe company used advanced techniques such as bulk defect passivation technology, a novel structure polysilicon contact, and metal-silicon interface recombination restraint technology.  Additionally, Canadian Solar announced that its majority-owned subsidiary, CSI Solar Co. Ltd., will begin mass-producing high-efficiency N-type TOPCon solar modules with a power output of up to 690 watts in Q1 2023.\n11\nInternet of Things\nSemiconductors in it For the Long Haul\nThe global market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is on track to reach a new peak in 2022, with original equipment manufacturers forecasting sales of $108.5 billion, a 6% increase from the previous record of $102.5 billion set in 2021.\n12\nThis marks three consecutive years of record revenue for the industry. However, the market is expected to experience a temporary dip in 2023, contracting to $91.2 billion, before rebounding in 2024 due to strong demand in both front-end and back-end segments.\n13\nAdditionally, the semiconductor ecosystem is experiencing a surge in growth, as companies leverage funding from the CHIPS Act to drive innovation and production, resulting in over 40 new projects, nearly $200 billion in private investments across 16 states, and the creation of 40,000 new jobs in the industry.\n14\nInterested in exploring thematic investing?

    "body": "Leave a comment\n34 Views\nWe return with a new episode about Microsofts eternal battle to acquire Activision Blizzard and have sagas like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Candy Crush in their possession.  The Microsoft purchase agreement is going to be one year old and after seeing yesterday the drama that took place between the FTC, Microsoft and the EU, we return to add one more character to this trio.  Now it is the turn of the PlayStation bosswho had an appointment with the antitrust chief of the EU to negotiate the agreement on Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.\nWhen Microsoft announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $68.7 billion, we were all taken by surprise.  We have never seen such a large number to acquire game studios and in fact, it is considered the most expensive purchase agreement for Microsoft.  But really everything makes sense when we know that it takes some of the most important studios in the world.  We have Activision with the Call of Duty franchise that sells millions of copies each time, Blizzard with Diablo, WoW or Overwatch and what to say about King Entertainment, the creators of the famous Candy Crush.  Looking at this repertoire, the US and EU regulators agreed on something, Microsoft would dominate the video game industry if it completes the purchase.\nPlayStation CEO talks to the EU about Microsoft and Activision\nMicrosoft has two main rivals who oppose the purchase of Activision Blizzard, being the US FTC and EU European Commission.  However, we recently saw an unexpected turnaround as European regulators tried to cut a deal with Microsoft.  This walked away from the accusations of monopoly and the opposition he presented to the company without changing his mind.  Well, with this deal, there was a chance to negotiate the purchase of Activision and of course, this reached the ears of the FTC, which intervened suing Microsoft.  So far we have come, but now an old rival returns and one of those who started this whole legal battle, Sony.\nSpecifically, we refer to jim ryanthe CEO of PlayStation, who is now reported to have met with the EUs antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager.  No details are given about the conversation, except that Jim and Margrethe were talking about the Microsoft and Activision deal.\nOn April 26, the United Kingdom will publish its conclusions on Microsoft\nHow this will affect the badly damaged state of Microsoft, we dont know exactly, but the situation is not looking good.  Lets remember that Sony has been at the foot of the canyon when it comes to defending the Call of Duty franchise.  In fact, this was the one that began by ensuring that if Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard, the PlayStation users would switch to the rival console, something that has undoubtedly influenced the EU.  All of this just makes one thing clear, Microsoft is surrounded by opposition and we dont see a hole where they can get out.\nWith that said, we are done with the deadlines imposed by the EU to make the final decisions on the deal.  The European Commission will have to decide before the April 11, although we do not rule out that it is brought forward due to what happened with the FTC.  On the other hand, the UK Competition and Markets Authority has delayed the date of its report.  Now it indicates that it will publish its conclusions on its investigation in competition regime next April 26."

    "body": "Copy article link\nSave\nNEW YORK  Before the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT was unleashed into the world, the novelist Robin Sloan was testing a similar AI writing assistant built by researchers at Google.\nIt didn't take long for Sloan, author of the bestseller \"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore,\" to realize that the technology was of little use to him.\n\"A lot of the state-of-the-art AI right now is impressive enough to really raise your expectations and make you think, 'Wow, I'm dealing with something really, really capable,'\" Sloan said. \"But then in a thousand little ways, a million little ways, it ends up kind of disappointing you and betraying the fact that it really has no idea what's going on.\"\nAnother company might have released the experiment into the wild anyway, as the startup OpenAI did with its ChatGPT tool late last year. But Google has been more cautious about who gets to play with its AI advancements despite growing pressure for the internet giant to compete more aggressively with rival Microsoft, which is pouring billions of dollars into OpenAI and fusing its technology into Microsoft products.\nThat pressure is starting to take a toll, as Google has asked one of its AI teams to \"prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT,\" according to an internal memo reported this week by CNBC. Google declined to confirm if there was a public chatbot in the works but spokesperson Lily Lin said it continues \"to test our AI technology internally to make sure it's helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.\"\nSome of the technological breakthroughs driving the red-hot field of generative AI  which can churn out paragraphs of readable text and new images as well as music and video  have been pioneered in Google's vast research arm.\n\"So we have an important stake in this area, but we also have an important stake in not just leading in being able to generate things, but also in dealing with information quality,\" said Zoubin Ghahramani, vice president of research at Google, in a November interview with The Associated Press.\nGhahramani said the company wants to also be measured about what it releases, and how: \"Do we want to make it accessible in a way that people can produce stuff en masse without any controls? The answer to that is no, not at this stage. I don't think it would be responsible for us to be the people driving that.\"\nAnd they weren't. Four weeks after the AP interview, OpenAI released its ChatGPT for free to anyone with an internet connection. Millions of people around the world have now tried it, sparking searing discussions at schools and corporate offices about the future of education and work.\nOpenAI declined to comment on comparisons with Google. But in announcing their extended partnership in January, Microsoft and OpenAI said they are committed to building \"AI systems and products that are trustworthy and safe.\"\nAs a literary assistant, neither ChatGPT nor Google's creative writing version comes close to what a human can do, Sloan said.\nA fictionalized Google was central to the plot of Sloan's popular 2012 novel about a mysterious San Francisco bookstore. That's likely one reason the company invited him along with several other authors to test its experimental Wordcraft Writers Workshop, derived from a powerful AI system known as LaMDA.\nLike other language-learning models, including the GPT line built by OpenAI, Google's LaMDA can generate convincing passages of text and converse with humans based on what it's processed from a trove of online writings and digitized books. Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have also built their own big models, which can improve voice assistants like Alexa, predict the next sentence of an email or translate languages in real time.\nWhen it first announced its LaMDA model in 2021, Google emphasized its versatility but also raised the risks of harmful misuse and the possibility it could mimic and amplify biased, hateful or misleading information.\nSome of the Wordcraft writers found it useful as a research tool  like a faster and more decisive version of a Google search  as they asked for a list of \"rabbit breeds and their magical qualities\" or \"a verb for the thing fireflies do\" or to \"Tell me about Venice in 1700,\" according to Google's paper on the project. But it was less effective as a writer or rewriter, turning out boring sentences riddled with clichs and showing some gender bias.\n\"I believe them  that they're being thoughtful and cautious,\" Sloan said of Google. \"It's just not the model of a reckless technologist who is in a hurry to get this out into the world no matter what.\"\nGoogle's development of these models hasn't been without internal acrimony. First, it ousted some prominent researchers who were examining the risks of the technology. And last year, it fired an engineer who publicly posted a conversation with LaMDA in which the model falsely claimed it had human-like consciousness, with a \"range of both feelings and emotions.\"\nGet Unlimited Access\nAfter the initial selected subscription period your subscription rate will auto renew at $12.00 per month.\nFacebook"

The move comes less than two months after the release of OpenAIs ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers queries with paragraphs of text or code, suggesting how generative AI might one day replace internet search.\nWith preferential rights to commercialise OpenAIs technology, Microsoft executives have made no secret of their goal of using it to challenge Google, reawakening an old rivalry that has simmered since Google won the search wars a decade ago.\nREAD MORE\nCan I lend half the proceeds of my house sale to a friend without Revenue involvement?\nDeepMind, a London research company that Google bought in 2014, and Google Brain, an advanced research division at its Silicon Valley headquarters, have long given the search company one of the strongest footholds in AI. More recently, Google has broken ground with different variations on the so-called generative AI that underpins ChatGPT, including AI models capable of telling jokes and solving mathematics problems.\n[\nChris Horn: Meet my new online friend: Michael D GPT\n]\nOne of its most advanced language models, known as PaLM, is a general purpose model that is three times larger than GPT, the AI model that underlies ChatGPT, based on the number of parameters on which the models are trained.\nGoogles chatbot LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, can converse with users in natural language, in a similar way to ChatGPT. The companys engineering teams have been working for months to integrate it into a consumer product.\nDespite the technical advances most of the latest technology is still only the subject of research. Googles critics say it is hemmed in by its hugely profitable search business, which discourages it from introducing generative AI into consumer products. Giving direct answers to queries, rather than simply pointing users to suggested links, would result in fewer searches, said Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former top Google executive.\nThat has left Google facing a classic innovators dilemma  a reference to the book by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen that sought to explain why industry leaders often fall prey to fast-moving upstarts. If I was the one running a $150 billion (138bn) business Id be terrified of this thing, Ramaswamy said.\nWe have long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve peoples lives. We believe that AI is foundational and transformative technology that is incredibly useful for individuals, businesses and communities, Google said. However, the search giant would need to consider the broader societal impacts these innovations can have. Google added that it would announce more experiences externally soon.\nWhile leading to fewer searches and lower revenue, the spread of AI could also cause a jump in Googles costs.\nRamaswamy calculated that, based on OpenAIs pricing, it would cost $120 million to use natural language processing to read all the web pages in a search index and then use this to generate more direct answers to the questions that people enter into a search engine. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that answering a search query using language processing costs about seven times as much as a standard internet search.\n[\nThis has moved the dial on assessment: Rise of AI sparks alarm on college campuses\n]\nThe same considerations could discourage Microsoft from a radical overhaul of its Bing search engine, which generated more than $11 billion of revenue last year. But the software company has said it plans to use OpenAIs technology throughout its products and services, potentially leading to new ways for users to be presented with relevant information while they are inside other applications, thus reducing the need to go to a search engine.\nA number of former and current employees close to Googles AI research teams say the biggest constraints on the companys release of AI have been concern about potential harms and how they would affect Googles reputation, as well as an underestimation of the competition.\nI think they were asleep at the wheel, said one former Google AI scientist, who now runs an AI company. Honestly, everyone underappreciated how language models will disrupt search.\nThese challenges are exacerbated by the political and regulatory concerns caused by Googles growing power, as well as the greater public scrutiny of the industry leader in the adoption of new technologies. According to one former Google executive, the companys leaders grew worried more than a year ago that sudden advances in the capabilities of AI could lead to a wave of public concern about the implications of such a powerful technology in the hands of a company. Last year it appointed former McKinsey executive James Manyika as a senior vice-president to advise on the broader social impacts of its new technology.\nGenerative AI, which is used in services such as ChatGPT, is inherently prone to giving incorrect answers and could be used to produce misinformation, Manyika said. Speaking only days before ChatGPT was released, he added: Thats why were not rushing to put these things out in the way that perhaps people might have expected us to.\n[\nUnthinkable: ChatGPT is creepily smart, weirdly chummy and a window to your extended mind\n]\nHowever, the huge interest stirred up by ChatGPT has intensified the pressure on Google to match OpenAI more quickly. That has left it with the challenge of showing off its AI prowess and integrating it into its services without damaging its brand or provoking a political backlash.\nFor Google its a real problem if they write a sentence with hate speech in it and its near the Google name, said Ramaswamy, a co-founder of search start-up Neeva. Google is held to a higher standard than a start-up that could argue that its service was just an objective summary of content available on the internet, he added.\nThe search company has come under fire before over its handling of AI ethics. In 2020, when two prominent AI researchers left in contentious circumstances after objections to a research paper assessing the risks of language-related AI, a furore erupted around Googles attitude to the ethics and safety of its AI technologies.\nSuch events have left it under greater public scrutiny than organisations such as OpenAI or open-source alternatives such as Stable Diffusion. The latter, which generates images from text descriptions, has had several safety issues, including with "
