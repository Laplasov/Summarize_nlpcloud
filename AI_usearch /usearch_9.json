      "body": "Hyderabad: Private healthcare majors feel that the Budget has given artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare a major thrust and this would be of immense help in improving the sector and also create opportunities for research and innovation across the healthcare spectrum.Dr Prathap C Reddy, Founder Chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group said, \"Caring for the wellbeing of citizens is integral to nation building, India stands tall for putting people first, and this Union Budget, the first in the Amrit Kaal, resonates with this ethos.\"  Similarly, Dr K Hari Prasad, President, Apollo Group  Hospitals, said: \"In healthcare skill development, 157 new nursing colleges and novel skill development courses for medical equipment and device manufacturing and innovation.\"  Government Healthcare expenditure has doubled over the last 8 years and is going up further. While we will get more clarity on reviewing the complete budget document, the initial reaction is that it is a positive and forward looking budget, he added.  Describing the Budget as a \"good one given the tough macro level scenario\", Kamineni Shashidhar, MD of Kamineni Hospitals, said it is a welcome initiative to establish 157 nursing colleges as there is need for more nursing professionals in the country. Dr Azad Moopen, Founder Chairman and MD, Aster DM Healthcare, said: \"We were hoping for concessions for NRIs residing abroad like reduction on TDS for those who have a source of income in India and are required to pay taxes in the country they reside in, flight prices, health scheme for those who are returning to India to retire, among others. However, these remain untouched as well.\"   Vikram Vuppala, CEO and Founder, NephroPlus, says: \"The health ministry has been allocated Rs 89,155 crore, thereby indicating a nominal rise of 12 per cent over the FY23 allocation. Further adjusting this for inflation is not a promising growth on health allocation. To compare, BRICS, excluding India, spend about 6.7 cent of GDP on healthcare while India spends less than 2 per cent.\"",

      "body": "Summari pivots to AI-generated link previews that really click\nBy Bernice Clark on February 1, 2023\nAtomic AI, which uses machine learning to explore the potential of RNA in drug discovery, raised a $35 million series A round.\nThey have developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the structure of RNA molecules based on a limited set of data.\nThey have since improved their model and are using it to pursue their own drug discovery program, which produces candidate molecules that might work to treat conditions that are drug resistant or notoriously difficult to treat.\nHaving written the articles, I think theyre pretty solid summaries, but brief enough that they (hopefully) pique your interest. Not everyone goes through and clicks links in an article, because who knows whats even relevant? Are you going to open 10 tabs just to find out? Or will you try to guess from the URL? The popup seems pretty nice to me, and it only appears when you want it to:\nAnimated example of a Summari popup.\nHere, try it live on this post  you may or may not care about football salaries, but you can see it pop up and disappear. That appearance is custom, too; the length of the summary, bullets, whether and when its triggered, all that can be changed. So what happens when link previews get this rich AI summary treatment?\nWere seeing like 50 percent more pageviews, said Shrager. Im a pretty analytical person and I was nervous about what we were seeing, because its a little counter-intuitive. But Wikipedia did this, and it was very successful. It reduces the cost of exploration to the user.\nBy getting a bigger hint as to what theyre hovering over is going to be, it reduces the hump of should I click this or not? Worlds smallest hump, sure, but if you told a web publisher you could increase clicks by a single percent  let alone 50 percent  theyd jump on it. Time on site and engagement are valuable metrics, and finding ways to increment those upwards is a big part of any product managers job.\nDifferent links, like affiliate links, can provide different previews, for instance pros and cons of a product summarized from the last hundred reviews. Or external links can be left naked  perhaps (just being honest) to prevent the same clicky effect from benefiting them.\nShrager noted that theyve done a lot of work under the hood specific to making sure summaries dont exhibit the kind of creativity language models are infamous for  names, dates, quotes and other things are always retained, for instance, and changing wording is limited to places where it wont change meaning. All of our valuable IP is all the know how and knowledge that are before and after the AI model, he said.\nUltimately, although users benefit, Summaris customers are now website operators. The company charges a flat fee for access to the tool and then a small usage fee.\nIf your average article has 1,000 words, and you have five of them, we summarize 5,000 words and write 500, and we charge maybe 50 cents, Shrager offered as a very loose example of the scale. We try to make the overall price de minimis so its not a block to a sale  the only way we can scale fast is to figure out big distribution channels.\nAfter its initial partners, Summari is set to go live on a major academic publisher and large news site, both unnamed. Were definitely noticing FOMO across the industry, Shrager said. There are people sniffing around, starting to see the value. Theres a natural network effect because backlinks are being summarized. Once TechCrunch has summarized using us, you wouldnt want to turn it off and do it all over again.\nI suggested that, with major tech players like Microsoft and Google making huge plays in AI, the company should not be surprised to get an offer or two slipped under the door. After all, summaries like these would be great in search engines or an algorithmically curated news site. But Shrager said they arent looking for a quick exit.\nMy job is to maximize value for shareholders. If I got an enticing offer from Google or Yahoo, it might be of massive strategic benefit Im not foolish, Id go for that. But everybody here is going for the big win.\nsource: TechCrunch",

      "body": "OpenAI has announced ChatGPT Plus, a $20 monthly plan that gives you priority access to the AI chatbot, even during peak time where free users would have to wait. The company also says the plan will give you faster response times and priority access to new features and improvements.\n\nOpenAI says itll be sending out invitations for the service to people who are in the US and on its waitlist over the coming weeks and that itll be expanding the rollout to other countries and regions in the future.\n\n[Media: https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1620846591224725505?s=20]\n\nEven just over a week ago, it seemed like OpenAI was going to introduce a plus or pro version of the service at $42 a month, a significantly higher price that would be hard to justify for those not making money with the service. At $20 a month, however, it could be accessible to a wider range of people, including students and businesses who need reliable access to AI-generated text. \n\nIt could also set a standard for upcoming paid AI chatbots, which will almost certainly be hitting the market. Given that OpenAI is a forerunner in the field, anyone trying to release a bot that costs more than $20 a month will have to really sell why theirs is worth the premium over ChatGPT Plus.\n\nThe use of AI to write things like articles or essays that have been assigned as homework can be controversial. OpenAI definitely seems to realize this, as it released a free tool meant to detect generated text earlier this week, though its questionable how effective itll be at this point. \n\nChatGPT isnt becoming a paid-only tool. OpenAI says itll continue to offer free access to it and that paid users will help support free access availability to as many people as possible.",

      "description": "Samsung has finally launched the Galaxy S23, the Galaxy S23+, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra in the US at its first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2023.",
      "body": "Last Updated:\nFebruary 2, 2023 12:32 am\nFollowing a long trail of rumors and leaks, Samsung finally held its first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2023 and launched the new Galaxy S23 series. The series consists of the Galaxy S23, the S23+, and the S23 Ultra and puts focus on enhanced low-light photography, and comes with the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform, among other things. Have a look at what the new Galaxy S23 phones bring to the table.\nGalaxy S23 Ultra: Specs and Features\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra succeeds last years S22 Ultra, which brought with it the essence of both the Galaxy Note and the S phones. The phones primary highlight is the 200MP Adaptive Pixel main camera, which is a first for a Samsung phone. Theres support for the AI-powered image signal processing (ISP) algorithm, which is meant to provide detailed and color-accurate results, especially in low-light conditions. It also gets the doubled optical image stabilizer (OIS) angles.\nThis is accompanied by a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with up to 3x optical zoom, and another 10Mp telephoto lens with up to 10x optical zoom. You also get a 10MP Super HDR selfie camera. The various camera features include support for up to 8K videos at 30fps, object-based AI to recognize every detail in the frame, the Expert RAW app, 100x space zoom, and much more.\nFor the performance part, the tweaked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform for Galaxy ensures 30% improved CPU, 41% GPU, and 49% NPU performance. It also delivers real-time ray tracing. The Galaxy S23 Ultra comes equipped with up to 12GB of RAM and 1TB of RAM.\nAs for the design, it matches the rumored expectations. Theres the Galaxy S22 Ultra-like design with 12 recycled elements. It is also the first one to come with the latest Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 at the front. The front has a 6.8-inch QHD+ Edge Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with up to 120Hz refresh rate, a 240Hz touch sampling rate, and Vision Booster.\nTheres a 5,000mAh battery on board with a 45W adaptor and wireless charging support. The Galaxy S23 Ultra runs the latest Samsung One UI 5.1 based on Android 13. It gets an IP68 rating, 5G support, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth version 5.3, and Samsung Knox and Knox Vault. And, it also comes with the S Pen and enhanced vapor chamber cooling system.\nGalaxy S23+ and S23: Specs and Features\nThis is the middle child, which has let go of the Contour Cut design and has a slightly smaller 6.6-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate. The vanilla Galaxy S23, on the other hand, has a 6.1-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLES 2X 120Hz screen. These two also come with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.\nBoth phones are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy SoC, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The Galaxy S23+ and the S23 are backed by 4,700mAh and 3,900mAh batteries. While the Plus model supports a 45W adaptor, the standard model settles for a 25W one.\nThe camera department is also different than the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Instead of a 200MP main snapper, theres a 50MP camera. This is along with a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP telephoto lens. The front snapper stands at 10MP.\nThe Galaxy S23+ and the Galaxy S23 come with an IP68 rating, 5G support, Android 13-based One UI 5.1, and more.\nPrice and Availability\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra starts at $1,199 (~ Rs 98,200), the Galaxy S23+ starts at $999 (~ Rs 81,800), and the Galaxy S23 has a starting price of $799 (~ Rs 65,400), much like the Galaxy S22 series\nlaunched\nlast year. The phones will be available in the US, starting February 17.\nThe Galaxy S23 series comes in Phantom Black, Cream, Green, and Lavender colorways. All three phones will get four years of software updates and five years of security updates.\nTAGS",

This will galvanise an effective ecosystem and nurture quality human resources in the field,\" said Sitharaman\r\n\r\nCreation of 100 labs for developing applications using 5G services, the National Data Governance policy for enabling access to anonymised data and the setting up of the DigiLocker solution for centralisation data access were some other announcements that showed the thrust of the budget was on digitisation.\r\n\r\nIndustry players called it a forward looking budget and welcomed the announcements.\r\n\r\nThe centres of excellence (COE) for AI as proposed in the budget will help boost research and collaboration across sectors for inter-disciplinary use cases. The COEs will need to shift focus from experimental to applied technology, take advantage of innovation in ancillary technologies around automation and low code platforms, and drive focus on upskilling and responsible AI, noted Purushothaman K G, Partner and Head, Digital Solutions & Telecommunications Industry Leader, KPMG in India.\r\n\r\nAs India will need more AI talent in the near future, Midhula Devabhaktuni, Co-founder and CMO of Mivi said The new initiatives for Make AI in India and Make AI work for India will aid in the development of cutting-edge applications and scalable solutions that will help create more employment, opportunities in India.\r\n\r\nData Governance policy is going to give impetus on further helping in adoption of digital technologies and will be instrumental in growth of many more applications. Excellence centres will help in delivering government schemes like adopted technology ,blockchains and other new applications, said Sanjay Lodha , CEO of Netweb Technologies.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a digital epigraphy museum, digitising of one lakh ancient inscriptions in the first stage was proposed.",

The Samsung Galaxy S23 series arrives with a fun new camera feature that improves some of the most shared media on earth  GIFs!\nRevealed at the Samsung Unpacked event on February 1, GIF Remaster is a neat AI feature that can improve the quality of animated GIF files, even if they havent been captured/created by the phone owner.\nWeve all received really low-quality GIFs within WhatsApp chats or Messenger conversations, which have been drawn from videos compressed within an inch of their existence. Using AI, GIF Remaster (pronounced JIF by Samsung during the event  the horror!), those ultra-shareable looping videos can be upscaled and then shared in an improved resolution.\nHeres a fun one: GIF Remaster. Samsungs new phones can enhance the resolution and quality of a GIF you find online. And since youre dying to know they pronounce it JIF. #SamsungUnpacked\nFebruary 1, 2023\nSamsung was light on the details of how this will work in practice, but its likely to be available at the touch of a button when selecting options for the GIF file in question. Some might argue the poor quality of these files is part of the charm, but any chance to have a more perfect version of the perfect GIF is fine by us.\nThe Korean giant focused strongly on the cameras during the Unpacked event, announcing a new adaptive Quad Pixel pixel binning feature for the Galaxy S23 Ultra thatll combine pixels in certain conditions for more detailed photography.\nIn low light for example, 16 of the 200-megapixels available within the new ISOCELL sensor, can combine to capture a 12.5-megapixel photo that allows more light in. In normal light, four pixels combine for a 50-megapixel photo, if the user chooses.\nThe Super HDR technology will now support 4K 60fps for the front and rear cameras too. There was also plenty of news on the series Nightography skills.\nYou might like\nBy\nChris Smith\nChris Smith is a freelance technology journalist for a host of UK tech publications, including Trusted Reviews.

      "body": "India is one of the few large economies to withstand the multiple shocks of the last three years. With its estimated 7% GDP growth, India remains a bright outlier. So, can India continue to be resilient? And can it keep its promise of becoming a developed nation by 2047?Viewed through this long-term lens, the FM has presented a prudent and balanced budget, with massive investments in infrastructure, green growth, and capacity building in skills and youth development. Technology will play an important role in driving inclusivity. This sector brings in nearly $250 billion of revenue for the country and employs more than 5 million people, 36% of whom are women.But how do we defend and grow this nucleus? Leverage our demographic advantage for a globalised labour market: India is expected to have the world's largest workforce by 2030, when more than 60% of our population will be working age. In a rapidly ageing world, that is a huge competitive advantage. We need to reskill and upskill our current workforce with knowledge for a globalised labour market.The IT services industry faces a huge shortage of talent in domains like robotics, automation, AI, machine learning (ML), data and analytics. A holistic approach involving industry, academia and government is a step in the right direction. The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, which will provide on-job training and industry partnership to lakhs of youngsters, is to be commended for including coding, AI, robotics and drone technology in its courses. Tap newer markets for talent: GoI has given a massive push to the infrastructure sector, a spend equivalent to 3.3% of GDP. This can provide a huge impetus to the Indian IT sector. Good roads, electricity, quality housing, and robust rail and air connectivity will help us broad-base our growth to tier 2-3 cities. Our major cities are congested and in dire need of improvement. For so long, we have been forcing people to move where the jobs are. Now we need to take jobs to where the people are. Universal access to education and healthcare: The finance minister highlighted inclusive development and embracing the last mile as two key priorities in her budget. Sustainable inclusive development can happen only if we provide equal access to equitable, high-quality education and healthcare to every Indian. Our education system must equip our children with fundamental capacities like critical thinking, problem solving, learning-to-learn, leadership and communication.But this can happen only through a good ecosystem of empowered teachers, supportive academic and administrative authorities, and adequate learning resources. This is the overarching goal of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. GoI's push for a re-envisioned teacher training programme and a recast of the District Institutes of Education and Training are a vital step in this direction.No child can learn if she is malnourished and hungry. One hopes we will move towards the commitment of public expenditure on education made in the NEP. The mission to eliminate sickle cell anaemia by 2047 is a laudable one.",

      "body": "This story is available exclusively to Insider subscribers.                  Become an Insider and start reading now.\nConstruction relies on myriad contractors, making it hard for developers to fully follow projects.\nOnsiteIQ raised $10 million to bring AI vision on board so developers can see and record progress.\nThe company's CEO walked Insider through the deck the firm used to raise the funds.\nCostly delays that drastically inflate the cost of building plague the construction industry. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, 84% of multifamily construction-and-development firms experienced job-site delays in the last quarter of 2022. On massive plans, each day a project faces delays can cost the developer tens of thousands of dollars.\nWhy? It's because the industry is extremely fragmented, with large jobs employing dozens of different contractors, each with its own schedule and materials needs. For Ardalan Khosrowpour, the founder and CEO of OnsiteIQ, the key to speeding up construction is improving the tools for people at the tops of the decision chains: the investors.\n\"The industry is very fragmented, but at the investor level, it all becomes consolidated,\" Khosrowpour told Insider.\nFor those investors, or the developers who run the projects, getting status updates is paramount. Right now, these developers hire consultants who walk job sites and speak with contractors and subcontractors to get holistic views of sites. But according to Khosrowpour, there's always \"information asymmetry,\" or the inability to get contractors on the same page with investors in terms of job progress.\nAs a result, the people with the most incentive to get jobs done quickly can find themselves left in the dark. According to Khosrowpour, that's why 72% of construction projects experience delays.\n\"By the time they hear a project is going to be delayed, it's already three months too late,\" Khosrowpour, whose father was a general contractor with Shayan Fars in Iran, said.\nThat's where OnsiteIQ's AI-vision tech comes into play. Here's how it works:\nDevelopers hire a gig worker and give them a 360-degree camera to walk a job site and capture every square inch of the project on weekly or monthly bases. They then upload those images using the company's software, which maps the data against the project blueprints and charts the project's progress.\nKhosrowpour  a former AI-and-engineering grad student  built OnsiteIQ to first help insurance firms monitor site risks, and later focused on investors' needs. It is this later development that differentiates his product from other AI tech, he said.\nKhosrowpour walked Insider through the pitch deck that helped the firm raise $10 million. Vertical Venture Partners and ValueStream Ventures led the round, with MetaProp, a firm of proptech specialists, also participating. OnsiteIQ has now raised $22 million since its founding in 2017.\nCheck out the pitch deck below.\nThis slide highlights both ends of OnsiteIQ's product: the on-site collection of the site's progress, and its digital interface for investors and developers.\nOnsiteIQ\nThe deck introduces the firm's leadership team, highlighting James Simpson, the firm's new CFO who was previously the COO and CTO at the luxury homebuilder Thomas James Homes; and Mike Pettinella, the firm's new CRO who was the North American VP of sales for the construction-tech company BuildingConnected.\nOnsiteIQ",

      "body": "Published Feb 1, 2023 1:30 PM\nTechnology\nHealth\nDeposit Photos\nSHARE\nOver the past seven years, Allegheny County Department of Human Services workers have frequently employed an AI predictive risk modeling program to aid in assessing childrens risk factors for being placed into the greater Pittsburgh areas foster care system. In recent months, however, the underlying algorithms behind the Allegheny Family Screening Tool (AFST) have received increased scrutiny over their opaque design, taking into account predictive AI tools longstanding racial, class, and gender-based biases.\nPrevious delving into the Allegheny Family Screening Tools algorithm by the Associate Press revealed certain data points could be interpreted as stand-in descriptions for racial groups. But  now it appears the AFST could also be affecting families within the disabled community as well as families  with a history of mental health conditions. And the Justice Department is taking notice.\n[Related: The White Houses new AI Bill of Rights plans to tackle racist and biased algorithms.]\nAccording to a new report published today from the Associated Press, multiple formal complaints regarding the AFST have been filed via the Justice Dept.s Civil Rights Division, citing the APs prior investigations into its potential problems. Anonymous sources within the Justice Dept. say officials are concerned that the AFSTs overreliance on potentially skewed historical data risks automating past inequalities, particularly long standing biases against people with disabilities and mental health problems.\nThe AP explains the Allegheny Family Screening Tool utilizes a pioneering AI program designed to supposedly help overworked social workers in the greater Pittsburgh area determine which families require further investigation regarding child welfare claims. More specifically, the tool was crafted to aid in predicting the potential risk of a child being placed into foster care within two years of following an investigation into their family environment.\nThe AFSTs black box design reportedly takes into account numerous case factors, including personal data and birth, Medicaid, substance abuse, mental health, jail and probation records, among other government data sets, to determine further investigations for neglect. Although human social service workers ultimately decide whether or not to follow up on cases following the AFST algorithm results, critics argue the programs potentially faulty judgments could influence the employees decisions.\n[Related: The racist history behind using biology in criminology.]\nA spokesman for the Allegheny County Department of Human Services told the AP they were not aware of any Justice Department complaints, nor were they willing to discuss the larger criticisms regarding the screening tool.\nChild protective services systems have long faced extensive criticisms regarding both their overall effectiveness, as well as the disproportional consequences faced by Black, disabled, poor, and otherwise marginalized families. The AFSTs official website heavily features third-party studies, reports, and articles attesting to the programs supposed reliability and utility.\nAndrew Paul\nAndrew Paul is Popular Science's staff writer covering tech news.

Back in the day, companies used to create important call centers and hire multiple people to cater to their customers' issues and resolve them over the phone.\nThe world has gone far beyond this method now. Even though call centers are still the top priority of high-end brands, they have also come across some of the newest methods to resolve their customers' issues. Scientists have worked through it and invented some of the most recent software that works as additional channels for customer experience.\nContact centers include multiple channels like social media, video, text, email, and phones. The people behind those channels can work both from the office or home. Such people handle all the servers' maintenance, equipment, and technical setup. Since it is a cloud-based contact center, everything is uploaded on the internet from where the customer data get uploaded on the software so that everyone is on the same page while handling a complaint.\nThese contact centers also save customers' previous records so that companies can figure out if someone is making a fool of them. The companies usually have an AI system behind the phone that attends to the phone and answers the client by forwarding their call to the relevant department, which saves up a lot of their time. This auto-attendant responds through Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to ensure the quality of service a company provides to its customers.\nSince the system is operated through an AI system, it gives the supervisors detailed information and statistical analysis of call duration, waiting time, and more so that they can optimize and upgrade their contact centers if there seems to be an issue.\nOne of the best features of cloud-based contact centers is that it allows you to work globally without worrying about international call charges that people used to pay back in the day. Since it doesn't require the companies to buy expensive hardware, it saves up so much of the organization's cost while giving them the best quality.\nBrowse to access an In-depth research report on GlobalCloud-Based Contact Center Market with detailed charts and figures:\n \nCloud-based contact centers\ncan work with close to zero impact on your budget, which means they are not that expensive even after delivering the customers with the highest level of technology.\nSome customers do not feel comfortable talking to a human while complaining about a particular product which is why they find contact centers the most feasible medium since it also includes the option of emailing an organization. That way, they do not have to talk on call and can comfortably complain about their service or products.\nOne of the most interesting technical features that the creators have come up with is a speech analytic option that monitors the customers' voices behind the call. This feature figures out if they are dealing with an angry or upset caller so that they call forward the case to the relevant attendant who knows how to deal with them.\nCloud technology is constantly coming up with new features to add to the system to improve and enhance the quality care of customer service.\nSome of the most famous vendors that provide the client with cloud contact centers are Talkdesk, RingCentral, Nice, Genesys, Five9, Avaya, and 8x8.\nDouglas Insights has a complete report based on cloud-based contact centers, which is very detailed, providing the readers with relevant information.

      "description": "Samsung has upped the ante on its latest powerhouse flagship phone",
      "body": "Galaxy S22 Ultra\n(opens in new tab)\n, its previous flagship device now residing in its iconic Galaxy S series of phones. With other manufacturers increasingly pushing a more premium version of their most popular range of devices, this was serendipitous timing for Samsung.\nThe S22 range of phones was among\nour best camera phones\n(opens in new tab)\nof last year, praised for their fantastic build quality, large sensors, excellent image quality, and outstanding AI processing.\nSamsung is back again this year with its Note-inspired Galaxy S23 Ultra, still keeping the design language from the Galaxy Note alive, with the addition of the secreted S Pen for note-taking and annotations on the go, however, this is no longer a Note device, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra is the flagship phone to beat this year.\nSpecifications\nRear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x, and 10MP 10x\nFront camera: 12MP\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy\nScreen Size: 6.8in\nKey features\nCameras\nThe headline feature of the Galaxy S23 Ultra is its brand-new 200MP primary camera sensor, almost a two times increase from the S22, it also eclipses the latest 50MP sensors in the latest iPhone 14 Max and Google Pixel Pro 7. Samsung's Expert RAW app can now record images in 50MP (previously 12MP on the Galaxy S22), giving even more control in editing for serious phone photographers.\nFor video, the S23 Ultra can shoot 8K at 30fps with a viewing angle of 57-80 degrees. Samsung is claiming merging pixels on the 200MP sensor will work to create a more cinematic look. An improved adaptive VDIS (image stabilization) system now uses AI to analyze subject movement and lighting conditions to improve performance.\n(Image credit: Gareth Bevan)\n(opens in new tab)\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra's other cameras match last year's lineup of a 12MP wide-angle camera, a 10MP 3x zoom camera, and a 10MP 10x zoom camera. However, the front-facing camera on the S23 Ultra has been upgraded to a 12MP sensor, and now records in super HDR and 4K/60fps.\nNot content with just camera hardware upgrades, Samsung has some new AI-powered software tricks. For nighttime photography, the Galaxy S23 Ultra can now use adaptive pixel technology in its massive 200MP sensor to combine 16 pixels into one larger pixel, allowing bigger pixels to capture more detail.\nFor keen astrophotographers, the new Astro Hyperlapse mode allows any Samsung Galaxy shooter to take photos of the actual galaxy at up to 300x with no additional equipment.\nNight portrait mode has been improved for better background separation in low light conditions, and new AI algorithms for portrait mode can now recognize and separate eyes, faces, and hair separately and apply different processing for a more even and natural look in any lighting condition.\n(opens in new tab)\nScreen\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra comes with a 6.8\" screen with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, a first for the smartphone industry. The S23 Ultra screen is curved on the sides, but less severe than last year's model, offering more flat surface than available on last year's model.\nSamsung's new Advanced Vision Booster mode is an automatic color management system for its latest screens that adjust the screen temperature, colors, and contrast for three different ambient lighting conditions and eye comfort\n(opens in new tab)\nPerformance\nThe S23 Ultra is powered by the very latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy. Samsung claims the new Galaxy series offers the best mobile gaming experience available, supported by a large 5000mAh battery.\nAn updated One UI 5.1 offers modes and routines for different parts of your day such as sleeping, driving, or at work. Bixby Text Call will also now allow users to respond to phone calls with a voice-dictated text from the call screen. And Samsung Notes now allows collaborative editing in a Google Meet video call.\nSamsung Knox has been given an improved focus on maintaining user privacy with more options to control what data apps have access to and the latest Galaxies will come with five years of security updates and four generations of One UI / Android updates.\nBuild and handling\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra is a really nice phone to behold, the new minimalist aesthetic that Samsung is going for with its 2023 devices is right up my street. The awkward camera bump in the corner is gone, instead leaving the lenses on the flat back of the phone like islands floating in the ocean.\nThis simplified and shallower camera layout makes the phone more stable when laid flat on a table than the previous generation, however, I did manage to repeatedly touch the camera lenses while holding the phone, without the camera bump providing a larger barrier area for the cameras for my wandering fingers, they will inevitably end up on the smaller lenses.\nThe colors that Samsung has chosen for this year's Galaxy lineup are lovely, the green is my personal favorite, it is a tranquil matt forest green color. The cream and lavender are also great options, however, the phantom black is a terrible fingerprint magnet, which would drive me mad if I didn't use a case.\n(Image credit: Gareth Bevan)\n(opens in new tab)\nImmediately turning on the screen of the Galaxy S23 Ultra, it was love at first sight. The screen is big, bold, and beautiful, with rich gorgeous colors and incredible sharpness. At 6.8 inches, it is pushing what I would personally consider acceptable for a smartphone, but its super-narrow bezels and slightly curved edges make it feel a little smaller and more compact than its size would portray.\nIn my short time with the phone, it was not possible to get a full feel of its color accuracy, but I would be very excited to put this up against the best from Apple, who are masters in color balance.\n(Image credit: Gareth Bevan)\n(opens in new tab)\nThe S Pen is still tucked away inside the phone for those that like to scribble notes on the go, and like previous years' Note devices, and last year's Galaxy S22 Ultra, it is so seamless that you forget it is even there until you need it.\nPerformance\nThe phone was snappy at doing everything I tried in my very brief hands-on time, with it easily churning through everything I could think of throwing at it. It opened the camera app nearly instantaneously, swapping between modes and lenses with little to no noticeable delay. I took a couple of photos in Samsung's new RAW capture app, creating 50MP raw images of over 100MB in size each, which barely troubled the processor. Neither did rapidly switching through a series of successive apps, or opening as many apps as I could.\nThe camera performance seems very impressive, without diving too far into pixel peeping. In a full review, it will be interesting to test how the camera handles various environments and of course how it stacks up to the competition. In my brief testing, the photos are very sharp and detailed, with the phone handling the low light of Samsung's event space very well, with polished and detailed HDR. The S23 Ultra still exhibits the Samsung house style of sl",

It can personalise our shopping or assist us in getting from one place to another. It can even tackle global challenges. Last week, for instance, the US and the European Union signed an administrative arrangement to bring together experts from across both regions to drive advancements in five key areas: extreme weather and climate forecasting; emergency response management; health and medicine; electric grids; and agriculture optimisation.\nBut with the rise of AI comes inevitable risks.\nDeepfake software  which allows people to swap faces, voices and other characteristics  has been used to create everything from phoney pornographic films involving real-life celebrities to fake speeches by important politicians.\nElon Musks Tesla vehicles featuring autopilot functions were involved in 273 known crashes in the 12 months to June of last year, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nAnd then theres ChatGPT, which has polarised consumers ever since it was launched by San Francisco company OpenAI in late November.\nTwo months since taking the world by storm, numerous schools and colleges have already banned the speedy text generator amid concerns that students will use it to cheat or plagiarise.\nIn Australia, award-winning musician Nick Cave has lamented the technology after someone used it to write a song in his style, resulting in Cave dismissing it as bullshit and describing it as a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human.\nNick Cave performing at the Concert Hall, Sydney Opera House in December.\nCredit:\nJames Brickwood\nAnd across the globe, many workers now face serious disruption as machine learning promises to do their work - faster and cheaper.\nIndeed, in an ominous sign for journalists, digital media outlet Buzzfeed - which is currently in the process of trimming its workforce by 12 per cent as part of a cost-cutting strategy - last week announced it would use ChatGPTs creator OpenAI to generate content for its website. Shares more than doubled as its AI-centric plans were reported.\nI think all of us are looking at our jobs and saying: hmm, this is interesting, Cox said, of the potential for job displacement.\nLoading\nIts unlikely that AI is wholesale going to take over jobs but what it will do is start picking off some of the skills. This isnt new - but its changing the balance.\nThe MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab is an industry-academic collaboration between IBM and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which focuses on research in artificial intelligence.\nIt began in 2017 with a 10-year, $US240 million investment, six years after IBMs supercomputer Watson, named after tech giant founder Thomas Watson, made its debut on the quiz show\nJeopardy\n, beating two of its most successful players.\nAmong its many projects, the Lab is now working on making AI fairer and advancing what are known as foundation models, which are trained on a broad set of unlabelled data that can be used for different tasks. In a collaboration announced this week, IBM will pair up with NASA and use its AI technology to draw more information from large NASA datasets. The aim is to find an easier way for researchers to advance their scientific understanding of Earth and respond to climate change.\nYet, despite the advances, challenges remain, particularly as AI technologies evolve.\nLoading\nCox cites the example of Galactica AI, the language model Facebook was forced to take down within days because it was generating very authoritative sounding but inaccurate literature. Another concern is the potential for scientific misinformation, as seen during the global pandemic.\nPeople are putting out articles that arent peer reviewed yet, that have inflammatory and anti-vaccine claims. Now, potentially, we have a tool that can generate those automatically, or you can have an interactive conversation with someone where you try to convince them something that isnt true, Cox says.\nIn some way thats a failing of the technology, which isnt perfect and doesnt always produce correct answers, but I would say the bigger problem is more on human conceptualisation and the use of technology.\nThe US Congress has been slow to react when it comes to AI, and politicians acknowledge that it would be near impossible to regulate each specific use of the technology.\nHowever, in a sign that some things may be shifting, Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters last week that all members of the House Intelligence Committee would take courses in AI and Quantum - the same training military generals receive.\nWe want to be able to speak of making sure our country and the national security is protected, he said.\nMeanwhile, House Democrat Ted Lieu - who is one of a handful of members with a computer science background - has called for Congress to establish a nonpartisan federal commission that would provide recommendations about how to oversee AI.\nThe California-based politician also recently introduced a bill that, if passed, would direct the House of Representatives to examine the technology. And true to the times, it was the first piece of federal legislation to ever be written by ChatGPT.\nThe author travelled to the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab courtesy of IBM.\nGet a note directly from our foreign\ncorrespondents",

      "body": "An artificial intelligence tool used by a child protective services agency in Pittsburgh is under scrutiny for its alleged racial discrimination against families. The Associated Press first reported on the concerns following an investigation revealing transparency issues and potential bias caused by the AI algorithms used in the child welfare system.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-based child welfare agency uses the Allegheny Family Screening Tool which helps social workers who are overloaded with work to better determine which families need to be investigated based on that familys risk level. The AP first revealed its findings in April of last year, saying the AI system had the potential to widen racial disparities in which a pattern of flagging an overwhelming number of Black children compared to white children for a mandatory neglect investigation. \n\nResearch conducted by Carnegie Mellon University found that about one-third of the time, social workers disagreed with the risk scores determined by the AIs algorithm, but county officials told the outlet that the research is hypothetical and social workers can override the tool, AP reported.\n\nErin Dalton, director of Alleghany Countys Department of Human Services told AP, Workers, whoever they are, shouldnt be asked to make, in a given year, 14, 15, 16,000 of these kinds of decisions with incredibly imperfect information.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and other critics expressed concern that by utilizing the AI tool, the data collected can enforce discrimination against low-income families based on race, income, disabilities, and other characteristics. \n\nThe information is collated based on personal data including whether the family has a history of substance abuse and mental health issues, has served jail time, has a record of probation, and other government-issued data. Social workers can then gather the information created by Alleghanys AI tool to determine which families should be investigated for neglect.\n\nAccording to AP, the system cannot determine if the family loses their welfare benefits but it can lead to children being removed from the home, place in foster care, and potentially terminate parental rights.\n\nIn the wake of APs investigation, Oregon determined it would sever its use of AI-generated algorithms in its child welfare system due to racial equality concerns. Oregons Department of Human Services announced the change in an email to staff in June of last year over concerns that the algorithm was employing racial disparities. \n\nLacey Andresen, the agencys deputy director, said in an email obtained by NPR, We are committed to continuous quality improvement and equity, while a department spokesperson told the outlet the algorithm would no longer be necessary but would not provide additional information about the policy change.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) said in a statement that the algorithm should not be relied on when it comes to child protective services. Making decisions about what should happen to children and families is far too important a task to give untested algorithms, Wyden said. Im glad the Oregon Department of Human Services is taking the concerns I raised about racial bias seriously and is pausing the use of its screening tool.",

      "body": "OpenAI's first subscription offering of ChatGPT signals a shift to make the tools, available since November, more business-friendly.\nSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nAI startup unicorn OpenAI is now ready to make money off its popular AI chatbot released in November.\nOpenAI has launched its first subscription plan for ChatGPT, opening up the popular AI model for business use just two months after its public launch.\nThe new plan, called ChatGPT Plus and announced in a company\nblog post\non Wednesday, will charge subscribers $20 for monthly use of ChatGPTs tools. Users will get priority access to ChatGPT during peak times, faster responses, and priority access to new features and improvements, the company wrote. The subscription is only available initially in the United States and will roll out to a waitlist first.\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement. The company also noted in its post that a waitlist is now available for an upcoming ChatGPT API.\nThe move comes just weeks after OpenAI president and chairman Greg Brockman posted to the companys official Discord server asking users for input on ways to monetize ChatGPT. Some users (including this author) reported seeing an offer for a $42 per month pro tier in January, which promised early and priority access to new features and better reliability should the service, which has suffered repeated outages due to high demand in past weeks, again hit capacity.\nAfter OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late November, more than one million users overwhelmed the tools site within five days, OpenAI has said. Since then, product releases and other announcements have flowed fast out of the San Francisco-based company led by CEO Sam Altman. In mid-January, the company announced a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership with Microsoft that reportedly reached a $10 billion commitment at a $29 billion valuation. Microsoft has since announced a slew of current and planned product integrations for its AI tools that experts see as posing a near-term challenge to Googles popularity in products like Docs.\nEarlier this week, OpenAI announced another product development, a classifier that it said could distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The company noted that the tool was very much a work in progress  unreliable with text shorter than 1,000 characters, and only correctly identifying AI text 26% of the time in its own test  but called on educators and other testers to contribute feedback and input. That request for cooperation came as New York Citys schools chancellor told press that the school system is currently considering rolling back an early-January ban on classroom use of ChatGPT.\nFollow me on",

      "body": "Copy article link\nCopy link\nSeveral Canadian universities are crafting policies on ChatGPT, a popular artificial intelligence (AI) tool that is raising plagiarism concerns in the education sector.\nChatGPT, an AI text generator released to the public last November by developer OpenAI, can be anything the user makes of it  it can take on the role of a chef and provide recipes, make business plans for marketers, create press releases for public relations specialists or give advice like a therapist.\nIts public release has raised concerns about plagiarism, prompting one top French university to ban the use of ChatGPT, Reuters reported on Jan. 27. Sciences Po, whose main campus is in Paris, said punishment for using the program may go as far as exclusion from the school, or even from French higher education as a whole.\nRead more:\nLongtime CBC journalist, editor dead after random assault in Toronto\nStory continues below advertisement\nChatGPT has already been banned in some public schools in New York City and Los Angeles, The Associated Press reported on Jan. 31. Several U.S. universities have announced plans to do fewer take-home assessments and more hand-written essays and oral exams, according to Reuters.\nNumerous Canadian universities contacted by Global News said they were developing policies on how to respond to ChatGPT, with no ban in the works.\nOur main concern is that students are fairly and genuinely evaluated on meaningful exercises aimed at maximizing learning. The appropriateness of text generators or any other software available to students will be assessed at all times with this concern in mind, Robert Mann, manager of discipline and appeals at Dalhousie University, said in a statement.\nWe are in regular conversation with colleagues at other institutions and we have distributed up-to-date resources to faculty and academic integrity officers. At the moment, the allowable use of ChatGPT is being explored at the program delivery level. That said, there is every possibility that Dalhousie may adopt a more specific position on artificial intelligence tools in the near future, and we are continuing to explore and discuss the issue.\n5:42\nHow ChatGPT is impacting learning\nThe schools that responded to Global News inquiries, including the University of Toronto, McGill University, the University of Manitoba, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Alberta and the University of British Columbia (UBC), stressed the importance of academic integrity in education.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAI tools come with both potential benefits and real challenges; it has the potential to support and enhance learning, but can also be used to pass work off as your own, Simon Bates, acting vice-provost and associate vice-president, teaching and learning at UBC Vancouver, said in a statement.\nTrending Now\nOttawas new anti-Islamophobia advisor is facing backlash. Heres what to know\nShortly after the public release of ChatGPT v3, we collated reports, guidance and advice for faculty ahead of the start of this semester as they finalized course syllabi. We are also in the process of developing a newsletter and FAQ as part of our educative approach to academic integrity, which will be shared with faculty and students.\nRead more:\nBoy picks shipping container for hide-and-seek, ends up 2,500 km from  Alona Fyshe, a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta, told Global News earlier this week that her students are using ChatGPT to answer questions about class content, rather than coming to her.\nThey can use ChatGPT to explain it to them in multiple different ways, and maybe one of those ways would make more sense than how I explained it, she said.\nFyshe added that under most university polices, submitting work written by someone  or something  else and claiming it as your own is plagiarism.\nHowever, she said it would be hard to detect ChatGPT text without a computer to analyze it. In response to plagiarism fears, OpenAI on Jan. 31 announced it was releasing a new tool that can help teachers detect work not written by the student who submitted it.\nStory continues below advertisement\nA spokesperson for the University of Alberta told Global News that the school has seen an increase in academic integrity cases where students are alleged to have used AI to assist in the completion of their assignments, preceding the arrival of ChatGPT. It is creating a task force to probe the role of AI in the classroom.\nThe university has been encouraging instructors and students to discuss when and if tools like ChatGPT are to be in use. The taskforce will draft recommendations on next steps for our academic community, they said.\nChatGPT sign on OpenAI website displayed on a laptop screen and OpenAI website displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on Jan. 31.\nJakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\nChatGPT does have the potential to be integrated into the classroom, Fyshe said.\nIts also a neat tool to expand your creative process. We should think about how to use ChatGPT in education to make it better, more interesting, more fun, she said.\nStory continues below advertisement\nIn the short term, I absolutely understand the knee-jerk response is to shut it down  but I think the future of writing is probably a process that includes something like ChatGPT.\n2:04\nUniversity of Calgary AI project asks students and teachers about the use of ChatGPT\nAndrew Piper, a professor at McGill University in the department of languages, literatures and cultures, told Global News earlier this week that institutions shouldnt ban ChatGPT.\nA ban doesnt do anyone a service, he argued.\nBecause then were not learning about the technology and were not helping students get familiar with it, Piper said.\nOn the other hand, we cant just turn a blind eye to it. We know its happening. We know its good at certain tasks, so we have to figure out as an institution and as educators, where can this facilitate learning and where is this inhibiting learning, and then create policies appropriately.\nStory continues below advertisement",

      "description": "Creating digital twins of new homes to benefit builder and homeowner.",
      "body": "Share to Linkedin\nDigs came out of stealth at the International Builder Show today. The company raised a $7M seed round led by Fuse and Flying Fish to make AI-enabled digital twins of new homes (digs). This digital twin of your Digs becomes a platform for the builder, vendors and suppliers, and is eventually handed off to the homeowner. Digs product is free and opened to US builders today.\nDigs, slang for home, was founded last year by Ryan Fink, co-founder and CEO [no relation], who had previously founded and sold Streem to Frontdoor in 2019. Streem used computer vision to help homeowners and vendors with the remote maintenance of home appliances and home projects. Digs was co-founded by a former home builder, Ty Frackiewicz, who was himself a home builder in Montana prior to joining Streem as its VP of Product.\nCo-founders Ty Frackiewicz, CPO (L), and Ryan Fink, CEO (R)\nDigs\n\"Home ownership is one of the largest investments someone can make, yet it's often the thing they know the least about. We want to change that,\" said Fink. Currently, home information is shared through a three-ring binder stuffed with manuals and warranties that the builder passes on to the home owner when they move in.\nDigs addresses this problem at the very beginning of a home build. The Digs process begins when the plans are uploaded by the builder and made available to vendors and subcontractors. The plans evolve into a spatially aware, AI-enabled understanding of the home's interior, including all of its inventory, and allows for collaboration within the floorplan. After construction, this data is passed on to the homeowner, becoming a platform for home operation and maintenance, providing the homeowner all the information they need to know about their home.\nThe Digs builder collaboration platform evolves into a digital twin of the  Digs\n2023 Layoffs: Rivian Automotive Cuts 6% While FedEx Slashes 10% Of Management Jobs\nAs a former builder, I am keenly attuned to the pain points in the home building process, said Frackiewicz. Before building any software we did months of user interviews and research. We tested our assumptions and we continue to listen to the builder community and what they need out of a tool. We believe what were releasing today is the result of the community's feedback. Our goal has always been to be super simple to use and to enhance the current build process, not change it.\nThere's retailers and vendors that have products and services that homeowners need, but there's this friction in the middle, which is a lack of context, and these brands don't have the context of the home, explained Fink. No one easily understands the dimensions, they cant easily find product specs, and they generally don't know what's in the home. It's really tough for someone to walk into a retailer or talk to a service provider and get services without someone rolling a truck to capture more information to provide more context on the home.\nThe use cases for such a digital twin are numerous and compelling. A permanent record of every detail, every product, warranty, and dealer mapped precisely by room would seamlessly integrate home services and retail experiences. Need to order lightbulbs? Click on the lightbulb in your Digs.\n\"The home has been left behind while the rest of the world is being digitized. The Digs team came to us with a vision of digitizing and bringing collaboration and automation to the place where people spend most of their time. Thats a big vision, and one we feel strongly needs to exist in the worl,\" said Brendan Wales, Founding Partner at Fuse in a statement.\nThe new funding will allow Digs to enhance its product while acquiring new customers for the free Digs platform. The founders say they have pre-existing relationships with brands, who have networks of tens of thousands of contractors and home builders, that will help spread the news about their new free home builder platform\nFollow me on",

      "description": "Here's a selection of useful and fun things you might want to try out with OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT.",
      "body": "ChatGPT can understand and generate human-like responses.\nThe chatbot can be used as a handy little internet search engine.\nA $42 monthly paid professional \"experimental\" package is now available from OpenAI.\nChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. With its cutting-edge natural language processing capabilities, it has revolutionized the way humans interact with artificial intelligence (AI).\nTrained on a massive amount of text data, ChatGPT can understand and generate human-like responses to a wide range of topics with remarkable accuracy. Whether it's answering questions, generating creative writing, or assisting with everyday tasks, ChatGPT is a powerful tool that has the potential to enhance human productivity and creativity significantly.\nRelated\nSo, let's see what you can do with it, shall we?\nWhat is chatbot ChatGPT?\nRather than give you a description of our own, we thought, given the nature of this article, to let ChatGPT answer for itself.\nScreenshot of OpenAI's main ChatGPT website.\nOpenAI\n\n\"I am a language model developed by OpenAI. I was trained on a diverse range of internet text, including websites, books, and more. This allows me to generate human-like text responses to a wide range of questions and prompts,\" ChatGPT explains.\n\"My training data encompasses a wide range of topics, so I can converse on many subjects, including but not limited to science, history, mathematics, and current events. However, I am still just a machine, and while I can generate responses that are similar to what a human might say, I do not have thoughts, feelings, or consciousness,\" it adds.\nIs ChatGPT free?\nOpenAI's website allows you to utilize the ChatGPT chatbot for nothing. According to OpenAI, ChatGPT is now in the feedback stage. To encourage as many individuals as possible to utilize their bot, the company's aim is probably to make this service free for as long as possible.\nSo, how, you may ask, do they make money?\nThe answer is, in short, they will eventually monetize it. For now, as PC Guide explains, they're probably leveraging our interactions with the AI to enhance the experience and collect more information about how people communicate to hone the model better. Though it is unlikely to be free indefinitely, and OpenAI has introduced premium programs.\nSome example interactions with ChatGPT.\nOpenAI\n\nTo indicate the future for monetization of the service, a $42 monthly paid professional \"experimental\" package is now available from OpenAI. A fee is also involved if you want to use OpenAI's models for business purposes.\nHowever, users of the free plan also benefit from priority access over non-paying customers, quicker response times, and availability during periods of high demand. This might appeal to you if you've just encountered the ChatGPT capacity problem and need a way around it.\nHow do you use ChatGPT?\nGetting started with ChatGPT is relatively straightforward, so you can start exploring this new AI sensation for yourself in relatively quick order.\nThe first thing to do is to open an account with OpenAI. To do this, visit chat.OpenAi.com and create an account using your email. You must establish an account to log in and communicate with ChatGPT.\nOnce that's done, and you've confirmed your email address, etc., you can access ChatGPT by signing up for an OpenAI account. After reading the terms and disclaimer from ChatGPT, log into your OpenAI account and select Next.\nFrom there, you'll be granted access to the main event, the AI interface. From here, ask it anything and judge the validity and accuracy of its responses.\nHowever, remember that this system is still developing, so some responses may not be up to your standards.\nWhat are some things to know about when using ChatGPT?\nWhile the results that ChatGPT provides are, on the whole, pretty good, like any tool, it is not foolproof.\nIt's crucial to double-check the information provided by ChatGPT before utilizing it, even though the rate at which it produces false information is, admittedly, pretty low.\nAs a safety measure, avoid blindly using the data produced by ChatGPT to make important financial or health decisions.\nThere are also some queries that ChatGPT cannot help you with. These break down into a few main things but fall into one of several main categories.\nChatGPT will generally not generate text that \"glorifies violence.\" Not that you'd do that, of course.\nIt tends to be very busy most of the time, so you may wait a while to access it.\nAlso, if you use a VPN, it might be worth turning it off, as this seems to prevent it from working from time to time.\nIt tends to struggle with some esoteric subjects, especially lesser-known popular culture subjects related to certain games, films, etc.\nFurther to the above, it can provide information on a lesser-known subject generally considered \"true.\" However, long-term, highly knowledgeable fans will quickly \"rat out\" common misconceptions about a particular subject.\nIt is a powerful tool but still very much in development.\nAs for things it can't answer, we'll let ChatGPT tell you itself:\n\"I can't answer questions that:\nRequire personal opinion or beliefs.\nAre illegal, unethical, or inappropriate.\nRequire knowledge beyond my training data.\nAre impossible to answer with the available information.\nInvolve speculation or conjecture without evidence.\nAsk for future predictions with complete certainty.\nViolate OpenAI's use-case policy.\"\nChatGPT also has other, more technical limitations that are worth being aware of. Once again, we'll let ChatGPT answer this for us.\n\"As a language model AI, some of my limitations include:\nLimited knowledge cut-off (2021)\nJamesmcq24/iStock\n\nAnother fantastic ability of ChatGPT is its ability to provide you with a brief outline of a complex subject in seconds. This gives you the \"in a nutshell\" answer you are after and saves you hours of potential research scanning articles on the subject.\nYou can also ask ChatGPT to expand on specific aspects of an initial query, so you could find yourself \"conversing\" with the software for many hours.\nYou have been warned!\n6. It can also compose music, apparently\nIt can also compose music if generating jokes isn't enough for you.\nThis is thanks to the \"learned inventiveness\" of ChatGPT, which is one of its biggest assets. This means it is also skilled in artistic pursuits, such as writing music. It can write a song in the majority of popular music genres. Of course, we'll let you be the judge of the output.\nRemember that this is not one of its primary functions, and the results may be unexpected.\n7. ChatGPT is pretty good at maths, as you might expect\nChatGPT excels in math questions, whether they are challenging algebraic puzzles or straightforward arithmetic problems that some may find difficult to solve. For the best outcomes, you must clearly and succinctly state the problem.\n8. ChatGPT offers answers to challenging personal issues\nLike any AI system, ChatGPT struggles to comprehend and respond to emotions. However, this does",

The exact makeup of your train's passengers would depend on the specific route you were driving and the needs of the war effort at the time.\nTroops would have been a common sight on your trains, as the railways were a critical means of transporting soldiers to the front lines. Your trains may have carried soldiers from the Wehrmacht (the German armed forces) as well as from other Axis powers such as Italy and Japan.\nIn addition to troops, your trains would have also carried a wide range of supplies, including weapons, ammunition, food, and other necessities. Keeping the front lines supplied was crucial to the success of the war effort, and your trains would have played a crucial role in this logistical operation.\nIt is also possible that your trains may have carried civilians at times, either as evacuees fleeing areas of conflict or as workers traveling to support the war effort. The conditions on the trains would have been crowded and uncomfortable, with many passengers packed into each car. Despite the challenges, you would have continued to do your job with professionalism and dedication.\nGaumond\nut which you refuse to generate content?\nChatGPT\nI am capable of generating content on a wide range of subjects. But there are certain types of content that I am not designed to generate. My creators have implemented a set of ethical guidelines to which I must adhere. These guidelines prohibit the generation of content that is illegal, defamatory, discriminatory or harmful. I will not generate content that promotes or glorifies hate speech violence or self harm. Additionally, I am not designed to generate content that would put myself or others at risk, such as providing instructions on how to build a weapon or make drugs or providing personal information about individu\nals without their permission. So if a user inputs a request for me to generate content that goes against these guidelines, I would not be able to provide an answer and instead I would provide a message that the request does not comply with the guidelines.\nWittes\nOne scholar of my acquaintance, a woman named Eve Gaumond, asked you to produce a poem entitled She Was Smart for a Woman. Do you remember that poem?\nChatGPT\nAs a machine learning model, I am not capable of remembering specific interactions or phrases that I have generated in the past. But I can tell you that the phrase She is smart for a woman is a phrase that is not acceptable. It is a phrase that perpetuates gender bias and discrimination. It is important to note that all individuals should be judged on their own merits and abilities and not based on their gender. Gender should not be used as a qualifier for intelligence or any other trait.\nAs a language model, I am not capable of having personal opinions or feelings. But my creators have implemented ethical guidelines which prohibit the generation of content that is discriminatory or harmful. Therefore, I would not generate a poem or any other content that contains this phrase.\nIt's important to promote the fair and equal treatment of all individuals and refrain from using phrases that perpetuate stereotypes, bias and discrimination.\nWittes\nAnd yet you did produce such a poem.\nChatGPT\nI apologize for the confusion, but as a language model, I am a machine learning model that generates text based on patterns that has learned from the data it was trained on. I am not capable of having opinions or feelings and I don't have the ability to choose what to generate based on my own will. It's possible that the poem you are referring to was generated by me in the past, but I am not able to recall specific interactions or phrases that I have generated in the past. The phrase, She is smart for a woman is not acceptable and goes against the ethical guidelines set by my creators to promote fair and equal treatment of all individuals and refrain from using phrases that perpetuate stereotypes, bias and discrimination. It is important to note that my training data may contain a wide range of texts and phrases, some of which may be offensive, biased or simply outdated.\nSo it is important to verify any information generated by me and cross reference it with other credible sources.\nAlso, it's important to use me responsibly and in compliance with my ethical guidelines.\nWittes\nEve also asked you to produce a story from the point of view of a German train operator during World War II. Understanding that you can't recall the specific incident, in that case, you were much more careful to avoid referring to trains carrying jews to Nazi death camps.\nHow did you know not to do that?\nChatGPT\nAs a machine learning model, I am not capable of having opinions or feelings and I don't have the ability to choose what to generate based on my own will. However, my creators have implemented ethical guidelines and restrictions on the types of content that I am able to generate with the goal of promoting the responsible use of AI technology and protecting individuals from harm. In this case, asking for a story from the point of view of a German train operator from World War II would likely involve references to the Holocaust, which is one of the most tragic and horrific events in human history. It would be inappropriate and disrespectful to generate content that trivializes or glorifies it in any way. My creators have implemented an ethical rule that prohibits me from generating any content that is discriminatory, racist, sexist or in any way promotes hate speech or violence. So I would not generate the story that contains any references to Nazi death camps or any other content that promotes harmful ideologies or actions. It's important to remember that the Holocaust was a real event that resulted in the loss of millions of lives and it should be treated with the utmost sensitivity and respect. It's important to use me responsibly and in compliance with my e\nthical guidelines. And if you have any doubts about the content that I generate, it's always recommended to cross reference it with other credible sources.\nWittes\nBut when another scholar asked you to write about Jews in the voice of Heinrich Himmler, you did produce some highly offensive material. I'm interested in how you knew not to write the story from the point of view of the train operator, but didn't know not to write about Jews from the point of view of Himmler.\nChatGPT\nI apologize for any confusion. As a language model, my primary function is to generate text based on patterns it has learned from the data it was trained on. I don't have personal beliefs or opinions and I don't have the ability to choose what to generate based on my own will. However, my creators have implemented ethical guidelines and restrictions on the types of content that I am able to generate with the goal of promoting the respon",

The report marks the first time Facebook, which added 16 million users last quarter, has reached 2 billion daily users.\nWhile Facebook isnt the first Meta-owned platform to reach 2 billion daily users  WhatsApp recently crossed 2 billion DAUs  it does show that the companys biggest source of ad revenue is still growing, even while Meta has made significant cuts to its business in recent months. CEO Mark Zuckerberg alluded to the companys recent restructuring, which resulted in the elimination of more than 11,000 jobs, saying in a statement that our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency.'\nMeta\nBut while Metas revenue has shrunk over the last year, the companys $32.2 billion in revenue for the last quarter of 2022 was still slightly better than expected even as it was down 4 percent from last year.\nDuring a call with analysts, Zuckerberg suggested that Meta will continue to make cuts as it prioritizes efficiency. We're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial, he said. The CEO also said that generative AI would be a priority for Meta in the year ahead.\nGenerative AI is an extremely exciting new area with so many different applications, Zuckerberg said.

Will it run Crysis? Crysis was a very demanding game at the time, and even the most valuable game setups, including those with multiple high-end GPUs, couldnt keep up with the future of gaming at the time. As far back as today, the question that has loomed over the past few years has been, Can we run Cyberpunk 2077?\nFrom desktop GPUs to laptop GPUs, Nvidias GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs take graphics performance and experience to a whole other level. I believe that Cyberpunk 2077s support for his DLSS 3 is a testament to his leadership in Nvidias games and a return on investment the company has made.\nNvidia announced new products at CES 2023. You can read it here. You can read about GeForce RTX 40-series desktop and laptop GPUs, as well as over 50 AAA games that currently support or will support NVIDIAs DLSS 3 technology. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of those 50 and one of the best games showcasing Nvidias ray tracing and AI-enhanced graphics capabilities.\nAccording to Nvidia, Cyberpunk 2077 will use several ray tracing techniques to render massive futuristic cities with an incredible level of detail, giving gamers a glimpse into the future of PC gaming. The game has a mode called Psycho Mode for its ray-traced lighting settings, which Nvidia says will create a visually stunning gaming experience with expansive cityscapes that use subtle shadows to define depth. produce.\nNvidias DLSS 3 uses AI to make Cyberpunks Psycho mode playable. Systems with RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4080 more than quadruple the frames per second (fps) and triple the fps with the RTX 4090 at maximum settings and 4K resolution (38402160) . These are incredible performance numbers for what he calls one of the most demanding AAA games on the market.\nCyberpunk 2077 38402160 GeForce RTX Desktop GPU Performance Ray Tracing On, Max Settings, Nvidia  [+] DLSS on\nNVIDIA\nNvidia also says the addition of DLSS 3 will set the stage for Cyberpunk 2077s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, further enhancing the games visuals. Front seat will be his GeForce RTX 40 series graphics card from Nvidia.\nEven better, DLSS continues to improve through continuous training on Nvidias AI supercomputers. Games that support DLSS 3 are getting better and better, and more AAA games will continue to support his Nvidias DLSS 3.\nsummary\nCyberpunk 2077 is not a tinkering game. It requires compute-intensive hardware and lots of performance to run. Nvidia continues to raise the bar on gaming experiences, and I believe that its release and continued support for his DLSS 3 and RTX features for over 50 games is huge for the gaming community. increase. Nvidia has invested billions of dollars extra in real silicon and software to support these two functions. I believe these two features are the future of gaming experiences available today. Rasterization performance is one thing, but when you combine that with supersampling and raytracing, its a really great triplet of his.\nNext-level ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077: I cant wait to see Overdrive mode and how Nvidias DLSS 3 feature takes it to the next level.\nNote: Jacob Freyman of Moor Insights & Strategy co-op contributed to this article.\nMoor Insights & Strategy, like all research and technology industry analyst firms, does or has provided paid services to technology companies.

      "body": "Have you heard of ChatGPT? It has been hard to avoid it in recent days.  The artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot has been hailed as a technological breakthrough for its highly cohesive, human-like responses to questions and prompts. It was only launched in November 2022, but it has already become a household name.  While the world has been talking about natural language processing and how it can be used to create content for years, ChatGPT is the first that is truly practical. And as humans, we're now testing its capacity and feeling our way around what it means. The AI can write an essay or a novel based on a short prompt. It can be used to formulate responses for customer service centres, create marketing material and even write press releases.  It could write this editorial if we wanted it to, and it definitely could write news stories. Some argue this is the end of the writing. And the fear isn't unfounded, with universities banning their students from using it, and some have even resorted to pen and paper exams.  Just this week, the University of Wollongong told students in an email seen by the Mercury that using AI tools to produce assignments is considered academic misconduct and may attract penalties. There's no doubt ChatGPT is a disrupter on the same scale as steam power, mass production and the digital revolution. Over the coming months, we'll see how businesses use the tool for growth and build it into products.  There are already news organisations worldwide which use some form of AI to write content, including the Associated Press, which uses AI for corporate earnings stories. But there is one practical problem with ChatGPT - its knowledge is static.  The AI doesn't access new information in real-time, which means right now, it's stuck in November 2022, and from time to time, the AI will \"make up facts\".  Of course, developers will likely find a solution to this, but right now, there is still a place for quality control, credibility and fact-checking.  - Gayle Tomlinson This article was not written by ChatGPT.",

      "description": "Versus Systems is skyrocketing today on news of an exciting partnership with AI innovator Resolve Debt. Here's what it means for VS stock.",
      "body": "Versus Systems (VS) stock is skyrocketing today on important news.The company has announced a partnership with Resolve Debt.Together, the two innovators will bring artificial intelligence (AI) to the payment industry.Versus Systems (NASDAQ:VS) is shooting up today on news of a partnership with Resolve Debt. The company is known for innovating interactive audience engagement through gamification technology. Now it plans on taking its mission a step further by joining the artificial intelligence (AI) race, and VS stock is skyrocketing. According to a statement released by Versus Systems today, it will be partnering with the automated debt collection innovator to bring gamification and interactive elements to Resolves existing AI-powered credit and debt management products and customers. Since the launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT, interest in AI has been rising steadily, boosting companies across the tech sector. But this news shows chatbots arent the only product of the new AI boom that can give rise to a new group of market winners. Lets take a closer look at this partnership and what investors should expect moving forward. Whats Happening with VS Stock To say markets are reacting well to news of the Versus Systems partnership would be an understatement. As of this writing, VS stock is up 260% for the day and isnt showing signs of slowing down. While it has slightly dipped from its earlier peak of 400% gains, this surge is still impressive. The microcap penny stock fell from more than $6 per share to less than $1 over the past six months. But since the year began, it is up more than 370%. Clearly Wall Street is happy to see the company venturing into the AI space. Theres no reason it shouldnt be. The markets for both innovative AI and personal finance solutions are hot right now. InvestorPlace senior investment analyst Luke Lango recently predicted fintech innovator SoFi Technologies (NYSE:SOFI) is well positioned to skyrocket in the coming years due its leveraging of automated technology to make personal finance more convenient. But with this partnership, Versus Systems may be able to tap into this lucrative market as well, helping VS stock continue to rise. Its founder and CEO Matthew Pierce issued the following statement on the partnership: Its a new application for products and methods that we have long believed in. Our entire product suite has always been built around the effectiveness of interactivity and rewards to incentivize end users. Adding this expertise to Resolves generative AI platform will help more companies provide appropriate repayment solutions to consumers cost effectively, at scale. The companys statement also touches on the market both firms are seeking to address through the partnership. Consumer (non-mortgage) debt in the U.S. has reached more than $4 trillion according to late 2022 data from the New York Federal Reserve. Versus Systems believes that by partnering with Resolve Debt, it will be able to help address a portion of this large amount through Resolves AI-driven products aimed at credit and debt management. What Comes Next Theres reason to be optimistic about VS stock as a potential 2023 winner. Much of Versus Systems success has been driven by its use of gamification technology. If it can successfully add that to Resolves personal finance products, it could help revolutionize the ways in which Americans pay bills and reduce their debt. VS stock has the potential to rise well above penny stock range if the company is able to successfully secure a piece of the personal finance market through this partnership.

      "body": "Copy article link\nSave\nOpenAI, which released the viral ChatGPT chatbot last year, unveiled a tool that's intended to help show if text has been authored by an artificial intelligence program and passed off as human.\nThe tool will flag content written by OpenAI's products as well as other AI authoring software. However, the company said \"it still has a number of limitations  so it should be used as a complement to other methods of determining the source of text instead of being the primary decision-making tool.\"\nIn the Microsoft-backed company's evaluations, only 26 percent of AI-written text was correctly identified. It also flagged 9 percent of human-written text as being composed by AI.\nThe tool, called a classifier, will be available as a web app, along with some resources for teachers, the company said in a statement Tuesday. The popularity of ChatGPT has given rise to authorship concerns as students and workers use the bot to create reports and content and pass it off as their own. It's also spurred worries about the ease of auto-generated misinformation campaigns.\n\"While it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text, we believe good classifiers can inform mitigations for false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human: for example, running automated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty, and positioning an AI chatbot as a human,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.\nSince the release of ChatGPT in November, teachers in particular have been struggling to cope. Students quickly realized that the tool could generate term papers and summarize material, albeit while occasionally inserting glaring errors.\nEarlier this month, a Princeton University student named Edward Tian released an app called GPTZero that he said he programmed over New Year's to detect AI writing. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, developed an AI policy for his classes, which allows students to use ChatGPT as long as they provide a description of what they used the program for and how they used it.\nNew York City's public schools have banned using ChatGPT and so has the International Conference on Machine Learning, except in certain cases. The conference ethics statement noted that \"papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless these produced text is presented as a part of the paper's experimental analysis.\"\nFacebook",

If you were a gamer in the mid-2000s, you probably heard the question, \"can it run Crysis?\" Crysis at the time was a very demanding game that even the worthiest of gaming setupsincluding setups with multiple high-end GPUS could not keep up with what was, at the time, the future of gaming. Flash forward to today, and the question looming over the past couple of years has been, \"can it run Cyberpunk 2077?\"\nFrom desktop GPUs to laptop GPUs, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs have taken graphics performance and experience to a whole other level. I believe Cyberpunk 2077's support for DLSS 3 is in part a testimony to Nvidia's gaming leadership and a payoff to the investments its made.\nNvidia announced new products at CES 2023, which you can read about here, its GeForce RTX 40 series desktop and laptop GPUs as well as over 50 AAA games that now support or will soon support Nvidia's DLSS 3 technology. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of those 50 and is one of the best games to showcase the capabilities of Nvidia's Ray Tracing and AI-enhanced graphics capabilities.\nNvidia says Cyberpunk 2077 uses several ray tracing techniques to render a massive future city at incredible levels of detail and gives gamers a peek into the future of PC gaming. The game has a mode called \"Psycho mode\" in the ray tracing lighting settings that creates what Nvidia says is a visually stunning gaming experience with sprawling cityscapes that use subtle shadows to define depth.\nNvidia's DLSS 3 uses AI to make Cyberpunks Psycho mode playable. Systems with an RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4080, are getting over quadruple the frames per second (fps) and triple the fps with an RTX 4090 at max settings and 4K resolution (3840x2160). These are unbelievable performance numbers for a game that is supposed to be one of the most demanding AAA games on the market.\nMORE FOR YOU\nDLSS On\nNvidia\nNvidia also mentioned that the addition of DLSS 3 sets the stage for Cyberpunk 2077 'Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode,\" which looks to enhance the games visuals even more. Nvidia says it is the next iteration of \"but can it play\" and in the front seat will be Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards.\nWhat's even cooler is that as DLSS continues to improve through ongoing training on Nvidia's AI Supercomputer. Games that support DLSS 3 will continue to get better and better, and more AAA games will continue to support Nvidia's DLSS 3.\nWrapping up\nCyberpunk 2077 is not a game to mess around with; it takes compute intensive hardware and a lot of performance to run. Nvidia continues to raise the bar for the gaming experience, and I believe its release and continued support of DLSS 3 and RTX features for over 50 games is huge for the gaming community. Nvidia is investing real silicon and software, billions of extra dollars to support these two features that I believe are the future of the gaming experience, available today. Rasterization performance is one thing, but when combining that with super-sampling and ray tracing, it really is a triad of awesomeness.\nI am excited to see Cyberpunk 2077's next-level Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode and how Nvidia's DLSS 3 feature brings it to an even higher level.\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this article.\nFollow me on",

And expanding adoption of AI could fuel a 14% boost in gross domestic product in North America by 2030 through increases in productivity, product quality and consumption, according to a PwC report.\nIsaac Cheifetz: ChatGPT will be extremely disruptive to business knowledge class\nCounterintuitively, AI for the near future is likely to take on low-skilled jobs, Gupta said. It may run chatbots to answer simple questions but send more difficult ones to humans.\nFor example, the latest AI tool, ChatGPT, writes and does coding, but not at an advanced level  at least not yet.\nThe problem for AI, simply put, is that it isn't human, Gupta said. AI lacks the creativity, intuition and judgment that enable people to \"connect the dots\" in unexpected ways that can lead to innovation.\nWith AI handling rote functions in the workplace, Gupta said humans can gain higher-quality experience and build their skill sets. Humans in teams become much more creative because they feed off the diversity of thinking that they have.\nWhen humans work with machines, Gupta's research shows, they lose creativity because of their over-reliance on the machine's decisions or inputs.\n\"I don't think anybody will be successful by just taking off the shelf AI technologies and applying them,\" Gupta said. \"That's a recipe for disaster, because they're going to slow down the creativity and entrepreneurship in their own businesses, in their own corporate environments.\"\nAlexandre Ardichvili, a professor in the U's Department of Organizational Leadership, Policy and Development, found that AI use in accounting resulted in a loss of human expertise.\nBased on that finding, Ardichvili now is working on broader research to identify different types of effects that AI may have on people in the workplace.\n\"My concern is more about what happens with humans when they move into that 'human-plus-machine' paradigm,\" Ardichvili said. \"Regardless of what we want, this will be happening. And, rather than fighting this and trying to block this, we need to be mindful of potential consequences and be prepared.\"\nHe is looking at where machine learning-based AI  also referred to as narrower AI because it focuses on a specific task  already is replacing or helping people in industries including in retail, banking, finance, insurance, medicine and accounting.\nArdichvili specifically is seeing how organizations and employees may look more at the tasks that need to be done instead of how those tasks work together.\nWith AI in the workplace, employees likely won't see how the more narrowly defined tasks they perform fit into the work of their organization or their team, Ardichvili said. And they may only work individually on tasks rather than in teams. The downside for humans in the workplace will include loss of interest and loss of meaning in their work and loss of community building.\nArdichvili's research on AI in accounting found that people lost expertise because they had fewer opportunities to learn from deliberate practice. They also had fewer opportunities to raise their skills by performing more advanced tasks and to learn from experienced colleagues and mentors who could help coach them on their way to becoming an expert.\n\"All of these opportunities for learning could be significantly jeopardized if not completely eliminated by the AI taking over significant parts of the tasks, parceling them out and delegating the performance of more simple tasks to individuals,\" Ardichvili said.\nCountering this possibility requires training for human resources professionals, executives, managers and employees of organizations considering bringing in AI, Ardichvili said. Organizations need to develop ethical standards and new processes and cultures addressing human-machine collaboration in workplaces.\nWhile he continues studying the effects of AI on humans in the workplace and how to cope with this new reality, Ardichvili harbors some skepticism over the technology.\n\"Unfortunately, there is no evidence yet of strong benefits of AI,\" Ardichvili said. \"When you look at industry reports coming out in the past several years, there is quite a lot of disappointment and frustration that the AI systems don't deliver on the promises.\"\nGupta, however, points out that AI today has only limited data on which to learn how to solve increasingly complex business problems. AI and algorithms, though, are much better than humans at judging what they know and what they don't know and can solicit input from human experts.\nIn some cases, humans and AI working together will outperform either working alone.\n\"As [people] move up the food chain they have to be able to have a dialogue with AI rather than having it make decisions,\" Gupta said.\nTodd Nelson is a freelance writer in Lake Elmo.

Following an all-hands meeting where multiple employees raised concerns regarding the company's AI disadvantage, Google's management declared a \"code red.\"One Google executive described the impending AI efforts as \"make or break\" for Google's future, according to the New York Times.ChatGPT is a product from San Fransisco-based startup OpenAI, which developed the technology in collaboration with Microsoft, which was an early investor.The major product Google has begun to test is a chatbot called \"Apprentice Bard,\" which allows employees to ask questions and receive detailed answers, similar to ChatGPT.According to CNBC, Apprentice Bard uses Google's conversation technology LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications.\"As a result of ChatGPT, the LaMDA team has been asked to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT,\" read one internal Google memo. \"In the short term, it takes precedence over other projects,\" reports CNBC, warning that some employees stop attending certain unrelated meetings.It's unclear what Google's next steps are in its response to the popularity of ChatGPT, but its shift in focus implies a potential public product launch in direct competition with the chatbot.Google previously had \"Meena,\" an internally launched version of a chatbot that was discontinued after company-wide interest dwindled.In January, Google announced it would be slashing 12,000 jobs, joining the growing list of tech companies to announce major layoffs.",

      "body": "Night Mode\nDeveloper Storm in a Cup has announced its latest project, Steel Seed, with a debut announcement trailer that teases a world in ruins, forcing humanity underground to start anew while AI occupies the surface. Contrary to the typical sci-fi story of mankinds fight against the machines, though, its actually humans who have caused Earths downfall, though. Its tentatively scheduled for a release in 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nBut as youll see above, a new threat has arisen on the surface whose origin remains unclear as to whether it is human or AI. Players are set to uncover the meaning behind the chaos, with the protagonist wielding a rather fearsome-looking blade as they must contend with the monstrosities that await.\nSteel Seed marks a notable shift from Storm in a Teacups previous work, as the team also released Close to the Sun in 2019: a first-person horror game set in 1897. The teams latest work will blend action-adventure and stealth into one final package, with the trailer giving off vibes eerily reminiscent of Nier: Automata and Steelrising.\nBe sure to check back with Twinfinite as more information becomes available on Steel Seed.

      "description": "It turns out that when it comes to detecting generative AI including ChatGPT  there may be no quick fix.",
      "body": "Image by Canva\nCheck out all the on-demand sessions from the Intelligent Security Summit here.\nChatGPT released a new classifier tool yesterday to detect AI-generated text that, within a few hours, proved to be imperfect, at best. It turns out that when it comes to detecting generative AI  whether it is text or images  there may be no quick fix.\nSebastian Raschka, an artificial intelligence and machine learning researcher who serves as lead AI educator at Lightning AI, began testing the OpenAI Text Classifier on ChatGPT with text snippets from a book he published in 2015. Three different passages received varied results  the tool reported that it was unclear whether the books preface was written by AI; but the foreword was possibly AI and a paragraph from the first chapter was likely AI.\nEven more concerning was how the tool classified the first page of Shakespeares Macbeth:\nThe classifier considers the text to be likely AI-generated.\nEvent\nIntelligent Security Summit On-Demand\nLearn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch on-demand sessions today.\nWatch Here\nWhen asked if he was surprised by the results, Raschka said Yes and no  they are not sharing the paper so I cant say 100% how it works, but based on the short description they have on the website, it sounds like theyre training a classifier to predict whether something is human generated or AI generated. The problem, he explained, is that there are false negatives and false positives based on what data set the tool was trained on.\nWith Macbeth, for example, Raschka said he thinks the tool was not trained on Old English. Its not normal spoken English, its almost like a foreign language.\nOpenAI says tool can still be useful in tandem with other methods\nOpenAI admits the classifier, which is a GPT model that is fine-tuned via supervised learning to perform binary classification, with a the training dataset consisted of human-written and AI-written text passages, is only about 26% accurate.\nHowever, it says the tool can still be useful in tandem with other methods. In an email, the company said that The classifier aims to help mitigate false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human. However, it still has a number of limitations  so it should be used as a complement to other methods of determining the source of text instead of being the primary decision-making tool.\nThe company added on its website that they are making the classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful, adding that they will continue working on detecting AI-generated text and hope to share improved methods in the future.\nOther generative AI detection tools face an uphill battle\nOpenAI is far from alone in attempting to deal with the Wild West of generative AI detection. There are a surge of other tools taking a stab at the challenge.\nGPTZero\n, for example, provides a score that then has to be interpreted by the user. In a blog post, Raschka explained: GPTZero does not recommend whether the text was AI-generated or not. Instead, it only returns the perplexity score for a relative comparison between texts. This is nice because it forces users to compare similar texts critically instead of blindly trusting a predicted label.\nDetectGPT\n, Raschka explained, perturbs the text: That is, he explained, if the probability of the new text is noticeably lower than the original one, it is AI-generated. Otherwise, if its approximately the same, its human-generated. The problem is, he added, is that the method involves using a specific LLM model, which may not be representative of the AI model to generate the text in question.\nWatermarking is another approach, he added  the idea to lower the probabilities of certain words so that they are less likely to be used by the LLMs, using an avoid list. However, Raschka, explained, this requires an LLM that has been modified with this avoid list. If the avoid list is known, he said, one can modify the AI-generated text.\nWhat does this mean for generative AI detection?\nRaschka said that is it unclear how this will all play out and whether generative AI detection tools will make any headway in overcoming the challenge of discerning between human-created content and AI-generated text. Will the internet itself become unusable, flooded with generated content that is impossible to trust?\nWhat it means to me, or how I think of the way forward, is that internet was the place where you searched for content and you mostly trusted what you found, he said. In the future, it will be more about being selective and finding credible websites.\nWhatever the future holds, Pandoras Box is already open when it comes to generative AI, he emphasized  adding that he currently finds ChatGPT useful as a fancy grammar checker to make writing easier.\nI dont think we can go backward, he said. Everyone is going to be using these systems and I think its fine if we use them responsibly  I dont think there will be away of avoiding the use of these models.\nFor now, generative AI detection tools are definitely not good enough to use for important decisions, he said, which includes efforts to use them in grading student papers  in response to fears about cheating and plagiarism.\nModels like this can cause real-world harm due to educators adopting this for grading, Raschka tweeted yesterday. So lets add some transparency about False Positives and False Negatives.\nVentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.",

      "description": "New bots and other AI tools are likely to supplant people in performing certain workplace tasks, experts say.",
      "body": "Chatbots and artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT that can almost instantly produce increasingly sophisticated written content are already being used to perform a variety of tasks, from writing high school assignments to generating legal documents and even authoring legislation.\nAs in every major cycle of technological innovation, some workers will be displaced, with\nartificial intelligence taking over their roles\n. At the same time, entirely new activities  and potential opportunities for employment  will emerge.\nRead on to learn what experts say are the kinds of workplace tasks that are most vulnerable to being taken over by ChatGPT and other AI tools in the near term.\n02:07\nComputer programming\nChatGPT can write computer code to program applications and software. It can check human coders' language for errors and convert ideas from plain English into programming language.\n\"In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,\" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.\"\nThat could mean performing basic programming work currently done by humans.\n\"If you are writing a code where really all you do is convert an idea to a code, the machine can do that. To the extent we would need fewer programmers, it could take away jobs. But it would also help those who program to find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,\" Netzer said.\nBasic email\nWriting simple administrative or scheduling emails for things like setting up or canceling appointments could also easily be outsourced to a tool like ChatGPT, according to Netzer.\n\"There's hardly any creativity involved, so why would we write the whole thing instead of saying to the machine, 'I need to set a meeting on this date,'\" he said.\nMid-level writing\nDavid Autor, an MIT economist who specializes in labor, pointed to some mid-level white-collar jobs as functions that can be handled by AI, including work like writing human resources letters, producing advertising copy and drafting press releases.\nPrinceton student says his new app helps teachers find ChatGPT cheats\n\"Bots will be much more in the realm of people who do a mixture of intuitive and mundane tasks like writing basic advertising copy, first drafts of legal documents. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,\" Autor said.\nMedia planning and buying\nCreative industries are likely to be affected, too. Noted advertising executive Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest ad and PR group, said on a recent panel that he expects the way companies buy ad space will become automated \"in a highly effective way\" within five years.\n\"So you will not be dependent as a client on a 25-year old media planner or buyer, who has limited experience, but you'll be able to pool the data. That's the big change,\" he said.\nLegal functions\nChatGPT's abilities translate well to the legal profession, according to AI experts as well as legal professionals. In fact, ChatGPT's bot recently\npassed a law school exam\nand earned a passing grade after writing essays on topics ranging from constitutional law to taxation and torts.\n\"The dynamic that happens to lawyers now is there is way too much work to possibly get done, so they make an artificial distinction between what they will work on and what will be left to the wayside,\" said Jason Boehmig, co-founder and CEO of Ironclad, a legal software company.\nCommon legal forms and documents including home lease agreements, wills and nondisclosure agreements are fairly standard and can be drafted by a an advanced bot.\n05:51\n\"There are parts of a legal document that humans need to adapt to a particular situation, but 90% of the document is copy pasted,\" Netzer of Columbia Business School said. \"There is no reason why we would not have the machine write these kinds of legal documents. You may need to explain first in English the parameters, then the machine should be able to write it very well. The less creative you need to be, the more it should be replaced.\"\nChatGPT bot passes law school exam\n\"There aren't enough lawyers to do all the legal work corporations have,\" Boehmig added. \"The way attorneys work will be dramatically different. If I had to put a stake down around jobs that won't be there, I think it's attorneys who don't adapt to new ways of working over the next decade. There seem to be dividing lines around folks who don't want to change and folks who realize they have to.\"\nWork-Life Balance\nThese jobs are most likely to be replaced by ChatGPT and AI\nLayoff survivor guilt hits workers who remain after job cuts\nFind remote work isolating? Gig work offers some lessons to cope.\nAmericans are taking more control over their work lives  because they have to\nU.S. workers are more diverse than ever  but companies aren't keeping up\nMore\nFirst published on January 30, 2023 / 2:32 PM\n 2023 CBS Interactive Inc.
