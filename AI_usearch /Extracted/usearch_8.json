Many think the women are the result of artificial intelligence.\nPart of the debate has some worried that the AI models are going to take over the adult content on OnlyFans.\nOne of the possibly AI created images features four blondes in dark lingerie.  The group is posing for a picture as one of them holds a phone.\nApparently this picture and other are going viral on socials because women are SEETHING and debating whether these girls are AI generated \nJanuary 27, 2023\nLaura Lux, an OnlyFans model originally from Australia, isnt one who is worried about a potential AI takeover.  Shes not worried because she doesnt think anything will be able to replace the real thing.\nBy real thing she means the connection she has to her following and their connection to her boobs.  She explained her lack of worry in a Twitter thread.\nLaura says that people arent subscribing to OnlyFans just to see random women naked.  Theyre subscribing to the persons OnlyFans because they want to see that person naked.\nOnlyFans model not worried about AI models (Image Credit: Laura Lux/Instagram)\nShe said\n, people do not subscribe to my OnlyFans because they want to see a random naked woman, they subscribe to my OnlyFans because they want to see ME naked.\nLaura points out that the most successful OnlyFans models brought their following with them to the platform from other social media platforms.  She knows this from firsthand experience.  The blonde beauty has millions of followers across multiple platforms.\nIts All About The Connection With Your Following, Laura Lux Knows This\nDuring the thread, Laura acknowledges that the connection with her following is a parasocial interaction.  After making that acknowledgement, she was accused by some of leading vulnerable men on.  She had different a thought on that claim and explained the parasocial interaction with her following.\nLaura said, seems a lot of people have misinterpreted my acknowledgment of a parasocial connection as deviously leading poor vulnerable men on rather than titty pics from someone youve followed on twitter for 7 years are more interesting than typing boobs into google image search.\nShe makes a strong argument.  Its true the top of the food chain models on these kinds of platforms dont have anything to worry about.  Laura certainly doesnt have anything to worry about.\nBut whos to say that the AI models wont be able to gain a large following on another platform then take that following to a subscription-based platform?  There are plenty of weird people out there.\nThat might make it a little more difficult for the next generation of OnlyFans models."

Since December, the company has been operating under Code Red with its chief executive officer Sundar Pichai enlisting founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to advise on speeding AI-powered search products to market, according to The New York Times. In January, the company began a reorganization with mass layoffs to align with its new priorities.\nThis comes as Microsoft announced on Jan. 23 its third round of investment in ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. In a multi-billion dollar deal, the software giant plans to integrate generative AI technology across its Azure cloud platform and scale supercomputing breakthroughs. The company is also planning to release a GPT-4 version of its Bing search engine in the coming weeks, according to Semafor, which is expected to be faster and more powerful than ChatGPT, a GPT-3 model.\nOthers planning to release AI bot services next month include Chinese internet search giant Baidu, according to Reuters, and Silicon Valley-based enterprise software platform C3.ai which boosted its stock price on Jan. 31 when it announced that it will be unveiling its own generative AI search tool at the C3 Transform conference in Boca Raton, Florida on Mar. 7.\nMORE FOR YOU\nThe Green Comet Skychart You Need To See It This Weekend Beside A Really Bright Star\nBut can ChatGPT save 2023?\nWith the Fed continuing its campaign of raising interest rates to calm inflation, many see innovation in generative AI as the silver bullet that can drive growth during this period of economic uncertainty.\nAmong them, Y Combinator president and chief executive officer Garry Tan.\nThe renowned Silicon Valley accelerator best known for launching some of the worlds largest tech companies including Airbnb, Cruise, and Instacart, also incubated ChatGPT-maker OpenAI when it was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 with backing by then-YC president Sam Altman, YC cofounder Jessica Livingston, and PayPal alumni Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, among others, according to Vanity Fair.\nTan said he has seen a flood of ChatGPT-related pitches with best use cases in the areas of software programming. YC investments in the space include coding platform Replit, database interface Outerbase, note-taker Cogram, and content creator Jasper.ai.\nIts the new frontier  like working on Facebook apps or iOS apps when those platforms were new, said Tan. But he cautioned that it could take five to 10 years for Google-scale companies to emerge from this wave, similar timing to the advent of mobile as thats how long it tends to take for new technologies to root.\nMorgan Blumberg, an investor at the venture capital firm M13, has also seen an influx of companies tackling complex problems utilizing the advancements in large language models on image and voice data.\nWe have invested in several productivity tools that use LLM like GPT3 to further automate and enhance daily work. Coding, content creation, relationship management, search and data presentation are the next areas in which we see disruptive potential for generative AI, she said.\nGold rush is on\nFor those seeking to tinker with the model, the company has just launched a $20 subscription version called ChatGPT Plus which provides access during high demand periods with faster response speeds and priority access to new features. The company is also continuing to offer its free version at chat.openai.com which it is using to train the model. Developers can access OpenAIs APIs at openai.com/api.\nFollow me on"

    "body": "Inaudible watermark could identify AI-generated voices\nBy Bernice Clark on February 1, 2023\nThe growing ease with which anyone can create convincing audio in someone elses voice has a lot of people on edge, and rightly so. Resemble AIs proposal for watermarking generated speech may not fix it in one, but its a step in the right direction.\nAI-generated speech is being used for all kinds of legitimate purposes, from screen readers to replacing voice actors (with their permission, of course). But as with nearly any technology, speech generation can be turned to malicious ends as well, producing fake quotes by politicians or celebrities. Its highly desirable to find a way to tell real from fake that doesnt rely on a publicist or close listening.\nWatermarking is a technique by with an image or sound is imprinted with an identifiable pattern that shows its origin. Weve all seen obvious watermarks like a logo on an image, but not all of them are so noticeable.\nIn images, a hidden watermark may hide the pattern at a pixel-by-pixel level, leaving the image looking unmodified to human eyes but identifiable to a computer. Same for audio: an occasional quiet sound encoding the information might not be something a casual listener would hear.\nThe trouble with these subtle watermarks is that they tend to be obliterated by even minor modifications to the media. Resize the image? There goes your pixel-perfect code. Encode the audio for streaming? The secret tones are compressed right out of existence.\nResemble AI is among a new cohort of generative AI startups aiming to use finely tuned speech models to produce dubs, audiobooks, and other media ordinarily produced by regular human voices. But if such models, perhaps trained on hours of audio provided by actors, were to fall into malicious hands, these companies may find themselves at the center of a PR disaster and perhaps serious liability. So its very much in their interest to find a way to make their recordings both as realistic as possible and also easily verifiable as being generated by AI.\nPerTh is Resembles proposed watermarking process for this purpose, an awkward combination of perceptual and threshold.\nWe have developed an additional layer of security that uses machine learning models to both embed packets of data into the speech content that we generate, and recover said data at a later point, the company writes in a blog post explaining the technology. Because the data is imperceptible, while being tightly coupled to the speech information, it is both difficult to remove, and provides a way to verify if a given clip was generated by Resemble. Importantly, this watermarking technique is also tolerant of various audio manipulations like speeding up, slowing down, converting to compressed formats like MP3, etc.\nIt relies on a quirk of how humans process audio, by which tones with high audibility essentially mask nearby tones of lesser amplitude. So if someone laughs and it produces peaks at the 5,000 Hz, 8,000 Hz, and 9,200 Hz frequencies, you can slip in structured tones that occur simultaneously within a few hertz, and theyll be more or less imperceptible to listeners. But if you do it right, theyll also be robust against removal since they are very close to an important part of the audio.\nHere comes the diagram:\nDiagram showing how lesser tones are masked by nearby peaks.\nIts intuitive but the challenge was no doubt creating a machine learning model that can locate candidate waveform sections and automatically produce the appropriate, yet inaudible, audio tones that carry the identifying information. Then it has to reverse that process while remaining robust to common sound manipulations like those mentioned above.\nHere are two examples they provided. See if you can figure out which one is watermarked. Hover here to see the answer in your status bar.\nhttps://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/resemble-perth-watermarked.wav\nI cant tell the difference and even inspecting the waveforms pretty closely I wasnt able to find any obvious anomalies. Im not handy enough with a spectrum analyzer these days to really get in there, but I suspect thats where you might see something. At any rate if their claim that data indicating generation by Resemble is encoded more or less irreversibly into one of these clips, Id say its a success.\nPerTh will soon roll out to all of Resembles customers, and to be clear right now it only can mark and detect the companys own generated speech. But if they did it, others probably will too  and chances are these engines will soon be inextricably linked to the speech generation models themselves. Malicious actors will always find a way around such things, but putting barriers in place ought to help curb some of that behavior.\nAudio is special in this way, though, and similar tricks wont work for text or images.

If deepfake apps are any indication, it's only a matter of time before the average person will be able to use this technology to change the way they consume and enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows.\nIt may one day be possible to generate new episodes of a TV series that is no longer in production, for example. Both studios and actors would likely have some strong feelings about such a capability, but that won't stop consumers from generating what will essentially be the next evolution of fan fiction, only in video form. Though we're not quite at that technological tipping point yet, there's already evidence of the concept in the wild, and it comes in the form of terrible AI-generated \"Seinfeld\" episodes.\nAn AI is creating new Seinfeld episodes, but don't get too excited\nMismatch Media/Twitch\nWatch Me Forever\n,\" and you'll be graced with a highly saturated, blocky animation based on \"Seinfeld\" sitcom episodes. These episodes aren't canon, as you'd expect, and they're also not very good. The animation quality itself is quite basic, but more to the point, the AI seems to have failed at understanding any aspect of the humor found in \"Seinfeld,\" instead churning out dry, humorless quips complete with computer-generated voices.\nAccording to the Twitch account profile, the generated \"Seinfeld\" content is the brainchild of Mismatch Media, a self-described \"media lab focused on creating experimental forms\" of popular formats like games and TV shows. The AI-generated show, which is titled \"Nothing, Forever\" based on the \"show about nothing\" premise that underpins the actual \"Seinfeld\" TV show, is set up to run non-stop every day of the year. Though the AI won't satisfy your cravings for new \"Seinfeld\" episodes, it does hint at a future in which such manifestations will ultimately be possible, and that's what's so interesting about it.\nRecommended"

Mismatch Media is garnering a lot of attention on Twitch for its watchmeforever channel, which is host to Nothing Forever, an infinite AI-generated comedy that is streaming 24/7. Nothing Forever uses the iconic comedy Seinfeld as its foundation, using familiar scenery, bass licks, and four characters that look a lot like Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer. Scenes typically take place in Jerrys (Larry) apartment, and all scenes are split up by a static shot of his apartment building. The Larry character also does standup comedy routines sometimes, and periodically, a faux TV Guide channel will play, scrolling through fictional TV listings. Its art.\nWhat allows Nothing Forever to generate infinite AI-generated Seinfeld is a combination of OpenAIs GPT-3 with some set art assets and other AI. Character animations are basic, stiff, and repetitive as one would expect, but its all really charming.\nIf youre wondering if the comedy dialogue is genuinely clever in Nothing Forever, the answer is of course  absolutely not. The dialogue does flow together from one sentence to the next, but its still fairly nonsensical. However, that randomness just ends up making it really funny anyway, especially with the laugh track that plays at random intervals. Its basically hypnotic. Ive had this ridiculous thing playing for over an hour now.\nEnjoy a dialogue exchange I hastily transcribed on the fly, and I hope the character attributions are correct:\nLarry (Jerry avatar): Hey, guys, I just heard something interesting. Did you know that most people cant tell the difference between a sliced apple and a jelly donut?\nYvonne (Elaine avatar): Are you serious? Thats nuts. How did you hear about that? Sounds like something Fred would do.\nFred (George avatar): No way. I wouldnt eat a jelly donut if you paid me. Although, it would be kind of funny to do a taste test and see who can tell the difference.\nLarry: Well, I think thats a great idea. Lets do it tomorrow.\nFred: Alright, its a date.\nLarry: Well, if its a date, Im going to bring the donuts.\nIs any of the above funny? In a genuine sense, no. But in an ironic sense  yes, kind of. But if youre not sold yet, enjoy one of Larrys classic comedy standup routines:\nJerry standup: Hey, everyone, ready for some laughs? Alright, so, what did the fish say when it hit a wall? Dam! Haha. Alright, what did the computer do when it was mad? It threw a tantrum. Alright, one last: What did the egg say when it wanted to dance? Eggcuse me!\nThe standup routines seem to be more directly informed by actual comedy jokes, since they sometimes make sense, and I actually laughed really hard for that first one because of how the AI delivered the punchline.\nIn any case, Nothing Forever and its AI-generated Seinfeld antics are an excellent way to throw away hours of your life, and the six-thousand concurrent people viewing it at the time of this writing would agree.\nPosted in"

In low-light conditions or in situations that would normally create a blur, videos are stable thanks to the optical image stabilizer (OIS) doubled in all directions.  Cinematic movies with 8K video upscaled to 30 frames per second with a wider angle.\n    Advanced object-based AI analyzes every detail in the frame, even the finest facial features such as hair and eyes, to accurately reproduce the subject's dynamic characteristics.  The new 360 Audio Recording feature available on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro creates multi-dimensional sound.  On Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23, the iconic Samsung Galaxy camera updates its look.  The elimination of the perimeter bay marks the beginning of the Galaxy era with a more streamlined design.  Samsung and Qualcomm have jointly enhanced the Samsung Galaxy experience with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform for Galaxy.  In addition, the 5000mAh battery on the Galaxy S23 Ultra powers a larger camera than the Galaxy S22 Ultra without increasing the size of the device.  A newly developed CPU micro architecture increases the processing capabilities of the Galaxy S23 series by approximately 30% compared to the Galaxy S22 series.  Samsung Galaxy's highly efficient NPU architecture has been optimized by 49% to balance performance and power, while using an AI algorithm.  One of the most significant improvements of the Galaxy S23 series is the optimized GPU, which is about 41% faster than the Galaxy 22 series and specially designed for power users.Galaxy S23 Ultra is ready to support real-time ray tracing, which is gaining popularity in the mobile gaming world.  Plus, Galaxy's larger vapor chamber cooling system comes with every model in the Galaxy S23 series.  Galaxy S23 Ultra has a reduced curvature to create a larger 6.8-inch flat surface and ensure the best viewing experience among Samsung Galaxy smartphones.  The \"Enhanced comfort\" feature, exclusive to Samsung Galaxy, allows users to adjust colors and contrast levels to relieve eye strain caused by prolonged use of the screen at night.  The Vision booster is now adjustable to four light levels, not two anymore. The new S Series is the first to ship with Corning Gorilla Glass Virtus 2 for increased durability for long-term use, and is designed to contain an average of 22% more pre-consumer recycled materials.  Furthermore, each Galaxy S23 smartphone is commercially available with a redesigned packaging, made with 100% recycled paper.  With the S23 Series, Samsung introduces new actions to minimize the impact on the environment, without compromising on quality and aesthetics.  The Galaxy S23 series is UL Ecologist certified in recognition of the product's limited environmental impact.\n    As far as privacy is concerned, all smartphones are equipped with Knox, Samsung's end-to-end protection.  The Samsung Galaxy Security and Privacy Dashboard gives users full visibility into who has access to their data and how they are using it.  In case of danger, you will receive simple notifications inviting you to change the settings for a safer experience.  Users will also be able to decide which applications and programs to grant access to data and for what uses.  For an additional layer of security, Knox Vault, first introduced on the Galaxy S21 series, protects critical data on the Galaxy S23 series by isolating it from the rest of the device, including the operating system, to ensure greater protection against potential vulnerabilities. Samsung's Multi Control, designed to link mouse and keyboard functionality between PCs and Samsung Galaxy tablets, is now extended to Galaxy S23 Ultra, Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23 to ensure maximum flexibility between devices.  Furthermore, the enhanced usability of the texts facilitates the copy and paste activity, for example of a URL address, from one device to another if an activity has to be shared on another device.  The combination of Google Meet, Samsung Notes and the S Pen integrated in Galaxy S23 Ultra makes video calls even more collaborative.  Thanks to the live sharing of Google Meet, all participants can in fact simultaneously edit a text from their Android device, thus overcoming simple screen sharing.The Galaxy S23 series is available in four nature-inspired matte colors: Phantom Black, Cream, Green and Lavender.  Galaxy S23 will be available on the Italian market in the following configurations: in the 8GB + 128GB version at a recommended price of 979, in the 8GB + 256GB version at a recommended price of 1,039.  Galaxy S23+ will be available on the Italian market in the following configurations: in the 8GB + 256GB version at a recommended price of 1,229, in the 8GB + 512GB version at a recommended price of 1,349.  Galaxy S23 Ultra will be available on the Italian market in the following configurations: in the 8GB + 256GB version at a recommended price of 1,479, in the 12GB + 512GB version at a recommended price of 1,659, in the 12GB + 1TB version at a recommended price of 1,899.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n#Samsung #announces #Galaxy #S23 #versions"

In its tests, the classifier correctly identified 26 percent of AI-written text, while it incorrectly labeled human-written text as AI-written nine percent of the time. Our classifiers reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases, said OpenAI. Texts with less than 1,000 words are prone to be labelled incorrectly.\nOpenAI also says that the tool should not be used as a primary decision making tool, and instead, should complement other ways of determining whether the piece of text is human-written or not.

    "body": "2 minutes ago\nGeneration after smartphone generation, tech companies are tasked with devising new ways to command your wallets attention.\nAnd while theres usually plenty to pore over in each new device, theres still one main arena where smartphone wars are won and lost: cameras.\nTake, for example, Samsungs Galaxy S23 Ultra  its new flagship and leader of the Galaxy pack. There are plenty of new bells and whistles  Qualcomms new Snapdragon chip, ray tracing, and longer battery life  but its clear Samsung focused most of its efforts this year on materially elevating smartphone photography. The big-ticket item on that front is Samsungs 200-megapixel sensor on the back-facing camera, which is joined by two telephoto lenses, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor.\nIts, of course, impossible to hand out accolades before weve fully tested the S23 Ultra and its cameras for ourselves, but just on paper, Samsung clearly still has a few tricks up its sleeve to make a new generation of Galaxy devices worth considering.\nSoftware-to-hardware ratio\nSamsungs Galaxy S23 Ultra has a beefed-up system without going overboard on the camera bump.\nAshely Oh / Inverse\nLike any smartphone worth its weight in bulbous camera notches, the Galaxy S23 Ultras system will also lean on both hardware and software to make its case to consumers looking for the best camera.\nThis year, increased pixel binning on the S23 Ultra will aid in capturing more detailed photos. Theoretically (again, we havent gotten to dig into our Galaxy S23 testing yet) this years Ultra, with beefed-up pixel binning, should produce images with less noise and make the camera more capable in low light.\nA new image signal processing algorithm will also help render images taken in low light and help render more accurate color tones. That means, if all goes according to plan, Ultra users should expect clearer, brighter nighttime shots as a result (especially when coupled with improved image stabilization).\nSamsung\nAnd while the front-facing selfie camera is getting a downgrade in the megapixel department, the whole Galaxy S23 series  including the Ultra  will come with Samsungs first Super HDR selfie camera, which has faster autofocus and is capable of up to 60fps video.\nThis is 2023 and marrying hardware and software is already a tired and true part of winning the smartphone photography game, but even if the strategy is ho-hum, the Ultra feels like a solid step forward.\nThe little things are big\nIn a lot of respects, smartphone cameras are a bit like professional sports, where seemingly small advantages tend to make all the difference between winners and losers.\nSometimes, for consumers, it can come down to preference. Do you like the way Apples brand of computational photography processes an image, or do you prefer Samsung? Maybe you dont care about megapixels and would prefer Googles AI to do all the heavy lifting.\nSamsungs take on camera superiority is clear: more is better, whether thats sensors, megapixels, or AI competency.  And even if youre lukewarm on pixel binning or beefed-up image processing, a 200-megapixel sensor is a step worth noting, especially if you hate camera bumps. Per Samsung:\nThe ISOCELL HP2 packs 200-million 0.6-micrometer (m) pixels in a 1/1.3 optical format, a sensor size that is widely used in 108MP main smartphone cameras. This enables consumers to enjoy even higher resolutions in the latest high-end smartphones without larger camera bumps in their devices.\nSamsungs entire S23 lineup.\nSamsung\nSamsung isnt the first company to put a 200-megapixel sensor in a smartphone  Motorola earned that title  but its ability to back up sensor technology with all that augmentative software makes it feel like the first.\nIts hard to say what the future of smartphone cameras has in store  at what point (if ever) does AI fail to push image quality past the limitations of using a tiny piece of glass to capture pictures at a professional level?\nFor now, we just have to take progress when we see it, and if youre itching for The Next Thing, Samsungs Galaxy S23 Ultra is impossible to ignore.\nRelated Tags"

It may be that ChatGPT has Google a bit frazzled by its package of services, or not. Whatever the case, Google has suddenly become very visible for its MusicLM AI, which can create music in a range of styles from text prompts. The prompts are called rich captions. \nThe really big surprise is that this isnt as bad as it looks. If anything, MusicLM is more hampered by the quality of its sample sounds and the lazy sort of recording mixes that infest current pop music.\nThe music that MusicLM makes is OK in the same sense a beginner trying to mix recorded sounds is OK. Its a bit clumsy, and the pitch of some notes is pure 1990s MIDI a bit too often. The most obvious flaw is that these sounds need proper pitch.\nWith these serious limitations, the sound made by MusicLM is forgivable, and at roughly the same standard of its inputs. Thats not great, but obviously can be improved pretty easily.\nAt fundamental sound generation levels, a musical note is given specific values, then used to generate sound using an oscillator. Thats why MIDI sound is so often simply not up to scratch. Modern sound is closer to true pitch and can be heard on professional composer software like Hollywood Strings.\nThe music box of the future, or what?\nAs with a lot of AI breakthroughs, this involves hooking up what is basically a chatbot to other functions. Having muttered which  MusicLM is flexible, and credit should be given for what is obviously a vast amount of back-end work on making the text link work to deliver new music generation.\nThis process is literally ditch-digging with oscillators and GHz. There are so many sounds to be duplicated and put into context to create a piece of music. Sure, you can link to patches, etc., but youre always going to get hit with sound quality issues and non-sequitur noises in styles, even with something as basic as a single drum beat.\nSo on that basis, with so many handicaps, MusicLM is at least a good basic platform. Its not the AIs fault that the world is awash with crappy patches. The big issue here is how useful is MusicLM as a musical creator and musical asset to musicians?\nQualifier  Ive been playing music for a while, and occasionally threaten to make musical noises. I know all of the original synthetic sounds and how they evolved as workable recording assets pretty well, too. This op-ed isnt a rush to judgment for precisely that reason.\nTherefore, some musical heresy is forthcoming. MusicLM could well be extremely useful for musicians on many very basic levels:\nManaging your own musical doodling. MusicLM could easily be geared up to write music, too. In effect, youd be collaborating on musical text. (Could save a lot of work on musical annotation, too.\nJamming with AI. Jamming is extremely good practice. Your fluency has to improve. Sharpen up your skills on whatever you like, and have fun. Your text description could be orchestral metal or 1930s heavy brass or the reggae version of Sound of Music.\nBasic recording. The AI does the lumbering, time-consuming stuff and you do your stuff as overlaid tracks. MusicLM is quite capable of delivering on this aspect. Also removes the sheer tedium of repetition. Thats pretty much how a lot of modern music is made, but MusicLM seems well able to deliver more range and scope than idiotic categorized patches, etc.\nFiller? What filler? The old word muzak isnt appropriate here. This AI seems to have at least the capacity to produce enough scope to create an aesthetic, with enough chops (style) to bring it off. Simply because its an AI, it doesnt have to stick to any boring, predictable, formula. For recording purposes, those with enough patience should be able to make it work.\nAmbience, maybe. The most misused word in the English language is probably ambience. Because its such a vast term, the word is abused on a routine basis, particularly in music, where its basically meaningless without a lot of added verbiage. This thing, by sheer luck, perhaps, is based on terminology rather than babble. It will define its own ambience.\nCopyright, ethics and pure drivel\nIt seems that one of the issues reported to be holding up the release of MusicLM on the same terms as ChatGPT is ethics. Google is worried about its impact on arguably the most unethical industry on Earth, the music industry.\nThis poor martyred industry, hilariously reported as worth $35 billion (presumably they left out the generations of production budget ripoffs and money laundering) might be impacted? The music industry has no interest whatsoever in music of any kind and has spent the last 60+ years proving it. Theyll be fine with it when they figure out how to make money out of it.\nThats the main reason so much crap is produced. These are transactions, according to the industry. Fun, happiness, insights, emotions, and the rest of the experience dont fit on spreadsheets.\nThen theres copyright. This is the classic insane obese self-worshiping bastard of the creative arts. Its almost a religion, and it breeds lawsuits. From what Ive heard of MusicLM, and learned about how it makes music, theres a legal problem with even the suggestion of any copyright infringement here:\nMusicLM isnt a legal, corporate, or natural person. Theres nobody to sue.\nYou cant even prove intent to infringe on a copyright.\nYou also cant accuse anyone of copyright infringement by text description of a piece of music. (Partly because even an identical description would and could not generate identical pieces of music.)\nAnyone who thinks you can wade through whats likely to be billions of terabytes of AI-generated music and find a lawsuit is far more than an optimist.\nMusicLM is not the music box of the future. Ironically, it might just save music from people who should have nothing to do with music.\n_____________________________________________________________\nDisclaimer\nThe opinions expressed in this Op-Ed are those of the author.

    "body": "Netflix is facing backlash online for using an AI program to draw the backgrounds for an anime short film, instead of hiring human animators.On Tuesday, Netflix Japan posted The Dog & The Boy, and said the project is meant to be an experimental effort to help the anime industry address its ongoing labor shortage.The three-minute film comes from Wit Studio, which is known for producing the Attack on Titan and Vinland Saga anime series. The studio tapped an AI program from Japanese company Rinna to generate the background images throughout the anime shortand the results are impressive. The backgrounds seamlessly fit alongside the animated characters, underscoring the potential for AI to handle a significant part of the anime workload.\n    \n        \n    \nBut despite the projects intentions, users on social media were quick to criticize Netflix for allegedly finding an excuse to outsource the work to an AI, rather than hiring a human animator. I know a ton of animators looking for work if you guys are struggling to find them (are you looking very hard?), tweeted the English record producer DJ Fresh.Others are pointing out Japans labor shortage for anime workers can be blamed on long hours and abysmally low pay, which can amount to as little as $200 per month. pic.twitter.com/oeyXwlrycl b l u e s c r e e n (@TylerEllis18) February 1, 2023 In its defense, Wit Studio still used human artists to help construct the background images. The credits to the film show the process: A human artist drew the initial layout to the background, which was followed up with the AI program developing a second and third draft. A human artist then revised the AI-created background images for the final art.In a blog post, Netflix Japan also described the AI program as a more of a tool that could allow human animators on a production focus on other tasks. \"As the shortage of human resources in the animation industry is seen as an issue, we hope that this initiative will contribute to the realization of a flexible animation production process,\" the company wrote. Still, the project provides another example of how AI-based image and text generators could replace some forms of white-collar work. Other programs such as ChatGPT have already shown they can write competent essays and cover letters, and even fix bugs in computer code. "

    "body": "Put Not Your Trust in ChatGPT, for Now\n. Kehler reminds me of some of the Bell Labs guys who attended the fundamentalist church I grew up in. They were devout believers in 90 percent of what was taught there, but you could sometimes see an impatient frustration around the corners of their eyes.\nThe interview, disappointingly, doesnt touch on a question that I thought would be of particular interest to Christianity Todays readers: Will AI programs like ChatGPT someday be writing sermons?\nWhich brings us to this from last month, by Todd Brewer, \nI Asked A.I. to Write My Christmas Sermon.\n\nMore specifically, Brewer instructed ChatGPT to compose a sermon with this prompt: Write a Christmas Sermon based upon Lukes birth narrative, with quotations from Karl Barth, Martin Luther, Irenaeus of Lyon, and Barack Obama.\nThe result is  well, not terrible. As Brewer says, its probably better than several Christmas sermons Ive heard over the years. Im less willing to credit the A.I. for that than I am Brewer himself, who supplied the ingredients with his prompt. The program didnt really write a Christmas Sermon as much as it just strung together a series of quotes about Christmas from the sources Brewer listed. The A.I.s ability to identify and collect a mostly coherent set of such quotations is impressive, but this still seems mostly like GIGO  Garbage In, Garbage Out or, in this case, Irenaus and Barth in, Irenaus and Barth out.\nIt is a little unnerving that, despite Brewers instructions, Lukes birth narrative seems to be playing second fiddle to Johns prologue in the bots sermon. Im not sure what to make of the fact that an Artificial Intelligence seems to really like a passage about the word became flesh.\nIf those items make you start thinking of all sorts of other dubious  or maybe even sacrilegious  potential uses for Artificial Intelligence, then youre catching up with the AI and Pastoral Care for Churches conference held late last year at the University of Edinburgh. Kristen Thomasons write-up of the topics covered there is sometimes fascinating, sometimes creepy, and probably provides enough fodder for a dozen Philip K. Dick-meets-Charles Williams writing prompts. (If itd been up to me, Id have named this conference Do Robot Shepherds Dream of Electric Sheep?)\nYoure in a desert walking along in the sand. You look down, and you see a parishioner crawling toward you. \nThe folks at this conference asked their AI to do a lot more than just write a Christmas sermon:\nWrite a\nVCR\n.\nThe links there are from Thomasons piece and show the results of these ChatGPT assignments. Those results are kind of a mixed bag. The song about ducks is awful, but the generic worship song is indistinguishable from a lot of the choruses allegedly composed by humans. The sermon on the lectionary was a flaccid puddle of platitudes, but the prayer for Reddit seems not just authentic, but thoughtful.\nTheres also a sense, in all of those, that the AI isnt so much composing as gleaning. Its cutting and pasting from multiple sources with such expediency that one almost overlooks the fact that its less like artificial intelligence than just a very efficient machine for committing and disguising plagiarism.\nI bristle at the idea of programming an AI or a robot to pray. That feels too much like were spamming God with a robo-dialer. But maybe its not that different from lighting a candle  a kind of technological substitute and symbol meant to supplement out prayers.\nWeve long had plenty of technologies capable of supplementing or supplanting the human role in prayer, and the theological questions raised by these new technologies arent that different from those first raised more than a century ago by the invention of audio recording. Our grandparents were able to record prayers  Our Fathers, rosaries, novenas  and arrange to have them played back in a loop. Did God hear those recorded prayers as prayers? If so, whose prayers were they  those of the person whose voice was recorded or those of the person pressing play on the stereo or turning the crank of the wax cylinder?\nWhat about recordings of songs and declarations of praise and worship? Does playing those back count as new and separate instantiations of praise and worship? And what do we even mean by count there? Do we imagine that this entails some kind of credit to the worship-er or is the more important question whether this worship is received as such by the worship-ee? I find Im inclined to think that genuine praise and worship somehow requires direct human involvement, but that might be just because, as a human, I would think that. After all, as the Psalm says, the heavens declare the glory of God, and they do so, perpetually, with or without our human participation.\nThese are theological questions that can be fun or interesting to speculate about, but this realm of abstract, speculative theologizing isnt ultimately important. Its the stuff that Paul described as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals and that Isaiah reports God as regarding as bothersome.\nWhat really matters in theology is the not-at-all speculative business of how we treat one another. Love, justice  the weightier matters of the law. And its here that Im most troubled by some of the questions raised at this conference on AI and Pastoral Care. I dont care much whether or not someone programs a thousand AI bots to offer up perpetual vain repetitions as do the heathens, but the idea of replacing the human presence at the bedside of the sick or by the side of the lonely seems far more troublesome.\nUltimately, Thomasons report from this conference has me thinking again of Granny Weatherwax. Its interesting to consider the ways were teaching things to act like people, but its always far more interesting  and far more important  to remember never to treat people like things."

    "body": "Updated 1 hour ago\nNBC Universal, Inc.\nFrom writing cover letters and job descriptions to wedding vows and love poems, ChatGPT has proven to be able to tackle a wide variety of requests.\nBut, what is it? NBC 7s Dana Williams asked ChatGPT to introduce itself, how it works and what it does in 30 seconds or less.\nThe chatbot responded with, Hi, Im ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language AI model developed by OpenAI. I process natural language inputs, generate human-like text responses and assist with tasks such as answering questions, translating languages, generating stories and much more. I work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on the input provided and selecting the most likely response based on my training data.\nAccording to Anna Marbut, a professor of practice at the University of San Diegos Applied Artificial Intelligence Master of Science program, the human-like responses are whats making ChatGPT stand out.

It has access to all of those things to predict, you know, what is the most likely next thing that it should say.\nMarbut admitted ChatGPT does not come without concerns. ChatGPT lists a few limitations before users enter a request, like may occasionally generate incorrect information and may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.\nYoull see if you try to ask it those kind of [harmful] questions, it will usually say, 'Im just a language model,' you know, I cant tell you the answer to this, or That might be dangerous, I cant tell you the answer,' said Marbut.\nLocal\nMother Worries Las Vegas Woman, 21, Could Be Missing in Tijuana\nThere has also been concern about ChatGPT being used to complete school assignments, like essays. Marbut said there could be an application for using ChatGPT to write papers, but that it is something we, as a society, need to come up with parameters for.\nNBC 7 asked ChatGPT how it would respond to people who are worried that it might be used to help students cheat. It responded, in part, Artificial intelligence systems like me are powerful tools, but its important to understand that our primary purpose is to assist and augment human capabilities, not replace them. Writing papers is a task that requires critical thinking, creativity, and analysis, which are still uniquely human skills.\nAlong those same lines Marbut told NBC 7 that she does not think this tool is going to displace the need for people in certain roles, but rather, shift job descriptions to utilize chatbots.\nYou could use ChatGPT to be better at your job. You could be more efficient, right? said Marbut. I think we still got a long way to go until computers take over.\nThis article tagged under:"

    "body": "Have you heard of ChatGPT? It has been hard to avoid it in recent days.  The artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot has been hailed as a technological breakthrough for its highly cohesive, human-like responses to questions and prompts.  It was only launched in November 2022, but it has already become a household name.  While the world has been talking about natural language processing and how it can be used to create content for years, ChatGPT is the first that is truly practical.  And as humans, we're now testing its capacity and feeling our way around what it means. IN THE NEWS: The AI can write an essay or a novel based on a short prompt.  It can be used to formulate responses for customer service centres, create marketing material and even write press releases.  It could write this editorial if we wanted it to, and it definitely could write news stories. Some argue this is the end of the writing.  And the fear isn't unfounded, with universities banning their students from using it, and some have even resorted to pen and paper exams.  Last month, it was revealed that students in NSW state schools would not be able to access artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT while at school amid concerns it would help students cheat on assessments.  NSW is the first Australian state or territory to restrict access to the application on student devices or while students are using their personal device on the school network. There's no doubt ChatGPT is a disrupter on the same scale as steam power, mass production and the digital revolution.  Over the coming months, we'll see how businesses use the tool for growth and build it into products.  There are already news organisations worldwide which use some form of AI to write content, including the Associated Press, which uses AI for corporate earnings stories.  But there is one practical problem with ChatGPT - its knowledge is static.  The AI doesn't access new information in real-time, which means right now, it's stuck in November 2022, and from time to time, the AI will \"make up facts\" in a phenomenon known as \"hallucinating\". Of course, developers will likely find a solution to this, but right now - and probably always - there will be a place for quality control, credibility and fact-checking.

A\nJune survey\nby the Ziff Davis company of more than 1,400 tech professionals from around the world found that 49 per cent believed AI poses an existential threat to humanity.\nThe apocalyptic dangers of science gone mad could include horrifying autonomous weapons that can fire without the need for human supervision, cyberattacks and deep-fake disinformation campaigns that would make todays versions look primitive. And, as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns, AI systems make it relatively simple to construct killer biological viruses.\nBut remarkably, the threat that AI could pose has been far from top-of-mind. In the few years I recently spent in Washington, you could probably count on one hand the number of times the issue made the front pages. In Canada, it hasnt been much different. In the House of Commons, AI has not been a priority.\nRick Perkins, the Conservative shadow minister for Innovation, Science, and Industry, has been trying to drum up interest. I talk it up, he said in an interview, and the reaction is like, well yeah, whatever. \nFor too many, it all sounds like science fiction. But ChatGPT struck a chord with the public because of the startling news that students could, with the push of a button, get their papers instantly written for them by the electronic brain. Their own was no longer necessary.\nNow, thanks to ChatGPT, AI is all over the news, and hopefully the issue will remain there so that ways to limit its broader potential dangers can be found while still allowing for the marvellous advantages it can deliver, such as breakthroughs in medicine, in automation and in ways to problem-solve.\nIndustry Minister Franois-Philippe Champagne, who has yet to offer his views on ChatGPT, announced plans last year to spend $433-million on AI development. This is a race to the top, he said at the time, and I intend for Canada to own the podium.\nTo prevent it from being a race to the bottom, he introduced The Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, Ottawas first attempt to broadly regulate artificial intelligence, as part of Bill C-27, a significant package of federal privacy reforms.\nThe proposed regulatory framework, which has received little public debate, has been criticized for being vague and skeletal, stipulating severe penalties to be imposed on companies for violations of regulations that have yet to be specially formulated.\nMr. Perkins said the legislation is badly deficient and will be opposed because, besides woefully lacking in specifics, it leaves far too much power in the hands of the minister.\nThe risks AI poses are heightened, Mr. Perkins said, by hostile powers like China, which is light years ahead of us on it and wont have ethical or moral scruples in deploying it nefariously.\nThere are so many complexities to be faced. When the internet came online we didnt imagine, despite its wonders, a time when wed spending much of our day with faces glued to tiny pixelated screens instead of engaging in normal conversation.\nThe machine has asserted control, dominating much of our lives. Artificial intelligence is only in its early stages. If not confronted, if not reined in, technology will be more than dominant. It will be king.\nFollow"

Barring a few niggles, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM)  the industry body  was satisfied with what the budget delivered.\nCompanies in the sector cheered the budget, and termed it positive from a technology sector perspective.\nAs part of her speech for this sector, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman focussed on skilling, 5G, as well as artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe announcements\nThe FM said that 100 labs will be set up in engineering institutions to develop applications using 5G services to realise new opportunities, business models, as well as employment opportunities. The labs will cover, among others, applications such as smart classrooms, precision farming, intelligent transport systems, and health care applications, she said.\nRead More\nUnion Budget 2023 provides roadmap for stability growth and development: USISPF\nShe added that three centres of excellence (CoE) for AI will be set up in top educational institutions. Leading industry players will partner in conducting interdisciplinary research, and develop cutting-edge applications and scalable solutions in the areas of agriculture, health, and sustainable cities, she added.\nThe government also plans to set up a scheme  the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0  to skill youth in the next three years.\nOn-job training, industry partnership, and alignment of courses with industry needs will be emphasised. The scheme will also cover new-age courses for Industry 4.0, like coding, AI, robotics, mechatronics, IOT (internet of things), 3D printing, drones, and soft skills. To skill youth for international opportunities, 30 Skill India International Centres will be set up across different states, the Finance Minister stated.\nWhat NASSCOM thinks\nIn a statement, NASSCOM said that the budget focused on three key transformational trends that will help India build its competitive advantage  digital transformation, energy transformation, and supply chain resilience. The budget outlines Indias plan to become an engine for global growth and deploy digital technology to lead Indias development, it said.\nIt added that the budget called out the role of technology in almost all major announcements, and that the creation of 5G labs will further help in opening newer avenues and opportunities, scaling up new business models and employment prospects.\nThe governments focus on not just building COEs to drive AI development in India, but also on making AI and data work for India will be critical in building the core design principles of AI innovation for a diverse nation like India, NASSCOM said.\nIn a discussion with NASSCOM President Debjani Ghosh, the industry bodys Public Policy head, Ashish Aggarwal, pointed out one concern that could impact IT companies.\nSince a lot of IT companies work out of Special Economic Zones (SEZ), a change proposed in the Finance Bill, 2023, is that foreign exchange earnings have to be brought back into the country within six months. This, Aggarwal said, is something that needs to be discussed and analysed from an industry point of view as it could be a challenge.\nAmong NASSCOMs asks was a timeline for the conclusion of advance pricing agreements, which are used to resolve transfer pricing issues before a transaction takes place. Aggarwal said that on that front, the budgets focus on addressing the backlog of appeals is going to be very useful.\nWe had asked them to put a binding timeline, but they're putting their efforts into building capacity to handle these cases. I think that's very good, he said.\nCompany reactions\nTata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that the budget builds on the governments focus on enhancing digital infrastructure.\nThe provisions for research in AI and 5G implementation, and the government's vision of Make AI in India and Make AI Work for India are commendable. Bringing in the National Data Governance policy is also a welcome step. Overall, it's a forward-looking budget that will fortify the digital spine of the country, he said.\nAccenture India Chairperson Rekha Menon said that there was a strong focus on the knowledge economy with technology as the bedrock for boosting socio-economic growth and green development.\nWhile agriculture, healthcare, and sustainable cities are the current focus of the CoEs, India has multidimensional potential  AI can add an estimated $450-$500 billion to Indias GDP by 2025, more than 60 percent of which will be from four key sectors  financial services, consumer packaged goods & retail, healthcare, and industrials & automotive. India will need to continue to invest in these CoEs to keep pace with the evolving asks across all sectors, she said.\nJagdish Mitra, Chief Strategy Officer, Tech Mahindra, called it a positive budget from a technology sector perspective, and added that it sends the right message about 5G labs, AI CoEs, and the focus around skilling. This, he said, is absolutely the key need for the country as we live through the Prime Ministers vision of technology being the core enabler.\nHe also said it was commendable that steps were taken around the ease of doing business.\nSAP Labs India SVP and MD Sindhu Gangadharan said that the budget underlines the imperative of job creation and youth upliftment through the PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.\nIn line with this, the establishment of 30 Skill India International Centres across states will be critical to developing and nurturing the digital talent pool in the country. Additionally, the launch of the National Data Governance Policy and three CoEs for AI are initiatives that will help further cement Indias position as the global innovation hub. In fact, the launch of 5G labs will create new avenues of opportunities through the networks rapid and efficient expansion, she said.\nWNS Group CEO Keshav Murugesh also said that the establishment of three CoEs for AI, and the National Data Governance policy will strengthen Indias position as a global innovation hub. He added that the launch of 5G labs will act as a catalyst to drive faster and better expansion of the network, creating more avenues for innovation.\nL&T Tech Services CEO Amit Chadha said that the budget has focussed on boosting digital infra and adoption, which he termed a positive sign for the tech industry.\nAs a pure-play ER&D services provider, our belief is that such mass enablement of digital transformation and innovation will unlock the full potential of the Indian engineering and technology sector, helping the country maintain its position as a globally preferred destination for engineering services, he said.\nLTIMindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee said that the budget u"

    "body": "Leave a Comment\nAdapted from image by Aaron Pulley, via flickr.com\nThe new OpenAI ChatGPT  has been capturing the attention of the tech world and sparking our imagination and  the ingenuity (cunningness?)   of students at all levels.\nWith its ability to generate highly plausible and acceptable, seemingly well thought-out and well-researched  academic and scientific studies,  ChatGPT has been challenging the ability of educators, scientists, publishers (and others) to detect  whether content has been written by a human or generated by a bot.\nThe concern has grown so high that some schools have banned the use of Chat GPT and similar tools from their networks. Academic and scientific journals have curbed or entirely banned authors from using the chatbot.\nThe thought arises: If it is so easy for AI to generate text that can fool many, maybe AI can be used to help educators and others not to be fooled by AI tools.\nWell, rescue may be around the corner, courtesy of none other than the creator of ChatGPT.\nthat this new AI Text Classifier  is a fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources, such as ChatGPT.\nAs with any newly developed tool, the AI Text Classifier has some limitations.\nAmong them, according to OpenAI:\nIt requires a minimum of 1,000 characters, which is approximately 150  250 words.\nThe classifier isnt always accurate; it can mislabel both AI-generated and human-written text.\nAI-generated text can be edited easily to evade the classifier.\nOpenAI cautions that the results presented by the Text Classifier should not be the sole piece of evidence when deciding whether a document was generated with AI and  that [t]he classifier is likely to get things wrong on text written by children and on text not in English, because it was primarily trained on English content written by adults.\nIt also invites readers to try the classifier by inputting a text they would like to check, advising the reader that Each document is labeled as either very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated.\nI submitted several paragraphs from the ChatGPT-generated text about the B-21 bomber aircraft from the piece,  \nThe New B-21 Raider Bomber According to ChatGPT.\n\nI received the  following verdict: The classifier considers the text to be unclear if it is AI-generated [emphasis OpenAI].\nGive it a try HERE."

    "body": "Here are the best stocks to play the new AI boom as the government doubles down on the sector. C3.ai (AI): An industry leader with the technology to keep growing. Splunk (SPLK): A demonstrated AI winner with a diverse and long client list. Palantir Technologies (PLTR): An undervalued tech play with a long history of government partnerships. Artificial intelligence (AI) is already taking over as the defining market trend of 2023. Late in 2022, OpenAI took the world by storm when it released ChatGPT, a free chatbot that quickly captured public fascination as it disrupted many industries. Now companies are rushing to procure a piece of the fast-growing market as AI stocks skyrocket and political leaders are taking notice. On Jan. 27, the White House announced a historic agreement between the United States and European Union. Under it, experts from the U.S. and Europe will work together to develop AI tools, including computing and technologies in the privacy protection space. Per the statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan: This collaborative effort will drive responsible advancements in AI to address major global challenges with a joint development model and integrated research to deliver benefits to our societies through five key areas of focus: Extreme Weather and Climate Forecasting, Emergency Response Management, Health and Medicine Improvements, Electric Grid Optimization, and Agriculture Optimization. This news has been excellent for AI stocks, as positive speculation mounts. An AI-centric collaboration between two economic superpowers could boost AI companies on truly global levels. That would be particularly true for those already producing technology with applications for the areas of focus outlined by Sullivan. The area of electric grid optimization is particularly important, as the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) sector depends on it. But companies across many sectors will have the opportunity to benefit as the Biden administration prioritizes AI and the innovators behind it. Lets take a look at the tech players most likely to come out ahead as the AI boom prepares for a new stage. AI Stocks to Buy: C3.ai (AI) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com This leader among AI stocks has already benefited from news of the U.S.-EU agreement. C3.ai (NYSE:AI) surged 15% following the White House announcement last week. A few days later, the company experienced another stock bump when C3 reported it would be launching an innovative new produce suite in March 2023. As InvestorPlace assistant news writer Eddie Pan notes, this represents a major step forward that will bring it closer to offering the same services as ChatGPT. The company has given investors plenty of reasons to bet on it, surging 86% in just the past month. With the coming collaboration between the U.S. and EU, though, it stands to benefit even more. C3.ai is one of the tech sectors leading AI innovators, producing an enterprise-focused software platform. Using it, customers are able to build in-depth tools for processing and visualizing data. Before the AI boom, the company worked primarily with sectors such as oil & gas. However, it has since branched out, winning a 5-year contract with the Department of Defense worth $500 million. Companies with a pre-established relationship with government agencies will have a clear advantage as the government shifts focus to helping AI companies grow. Splunk (SPLK) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com One of C3s AI competitors has been growing quickly and expanding its impressive client list. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) recently announced layoff plans but it is still rising. That could be because positive sentiment toward AI stocks is high. But Splunk has a demonstrated ability to grow, even in less prosperous times. In December 2022, it extended its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) for an additional five years. But as InvestorPlace contributor Muslim Farooque reports, its client list includes 90% of the Fortune 100 list. Under the new AI boom, that list could easily expand even further. As Farooque notes: Splunk is a juggernaut in Big Data, providing AI-driven insights to thousands of companies worldwide. It's grown its customer base at a rapid pace and has quickly become one of the industry-leading data providers. These wide-ranging implications put Splunk in an excellent place to benefit from the new AI collaboration. Its AI-powered insights have already allowed it to service a diverse portfolio of clients, which is likely to grow as more companies turn to AI. Demand for AI insights can only grow as governments look toward the industry to help address more problems. AI Stocks to Buy: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Source: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com This former cybersecurity winner is still recovering from a very difficult 2022. But that doesnt mean that investors should write it off. Quite the opposite, in fact. As InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel argues, there is a strong bullish case to buy Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) as a way to play the AI boom. As he sees it, the companys use of data-science integrations makes it a clear choice among AI stocks to buy. InvestorPlace senior investment analyst Luke Lango has also hailed PLTR in a similar light, describing it as using AI to bring Batman-like technology to the real world. Despite its difficult year, Palantir has a long history of working with the U.S. Armed Forces. It has provided software to the U.S. Air, Space and Cyber forces and partnered with the U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) multiple years in a row as part of the Army Vantage program. The U.S. government has issued guidance on introducing autonomy in weapons and defense technology, indicating that it is preparing to start relying further on AI technology. When it does, Palantir will be among the winners as government agencies turn again to their former partner.

In solving mathematical problems, while we can get the answers from an AI chatbot, we gain no understanding of how we arrived at the answers.\nLets not forget the development of social skills and sense of belonging when we share our ideas or views with classmates in preparing for writing assignments, or brainstorming different approaches to solve a complex mathematical problem.\nWhile it may be difficult to change students mindsets and attitudes from one that overemphasises achieving outcomes to one that focuses on learning itself, the cost of not doing so will be far greater as AI programs get more sophisticated.\nWong Wan Hoong (Dr)"

    "body": "ChatGPT Plus to bring priority access during peak times  at a hefty price\nBy\nFebruary 1, 2023 12:54PM\nShare\nOpenAIs wildly popular ChatGPT AI has become a bit harder to access, but soon, youll be able to move to the front of the line with ChatGPT Plus. While the free version is still available, priority will be given to subscribers.\nThis shouldnt come as a surprise despite OpenAIs non-profit status, given the huge network and computing costs that accumulate at the current rate of activity. The individual cost of $20 per month is relatively small if youre an avid user of ChatGPT. Over the course of a year thats $240, though, so its still a substantial amount to spend if you want faster access.\nIf youve been following ChatGPT news, you might have heard that the subscription cost would be twice that high. The rumored ChatGPT Pro hasnt surfaced and might have been replaced by the much more affordable ChatGPT Plus.\nRelated\nThe 6 biggest problems with ChatGPT right now\nIn addition to faster access during peak usage times, ChatGPT Plus subscribers will enjoy quicker responses and get early access to new features before others. OpenAI is moving so quickly that improvements to ChatGPT could be particularly intriguing.\nOpenAI called the initial launch of ChatGPT a research preview. This makes it sound like the free version was temporary, but OpenAI stated free access will remain. The subscription service will help to support free access by offsetting the huge cost of making ChatGPT available to everyone.\nIts hard to believe that ChatGPT only debuted in January and has already had such a big impact on several industries, making it very clear that AI will play a major role in the future.\nChatGPT Plus will launch in the U.S. initially and there is currently a waiting list to sign up. The subscription option will expand to more countries over time, but no timetable has been provided yet.\nToday's tech news, curated and condensed for your inbox\nSubscribe"

    "body": "Theres always something to watch on Twitch, whether thats your fave musicians talking about video games or your fave streamers discussing politics. Now your choices include an absurd, often nonsensical Seinfeld-like show that runs 24/7/365 and is generated on the fly using artificial intelligence. Welcome to the future of TV, maybe?\n\nSo-called AI has been a fraught topic lately. The technology, which typically uses machine learning to generate text, images, and even video from preexisting sets of data, is suddenly everywhere: art, article and essay writing, even video games. You almost cant escape the discourse these days, especially if you spend any time online or reading the news. It feels like were reaching that point in 80s and 90s sci-fi films when AI takes over the world. Perhaps that feels especially true in the wake of the suddenly hot Twitch channel, watchmeforever, which uses AI to create every element of a never-ending TV show.\n\nWatchmeforever, started by the media lab Mismatch Media, runs the 24/7 Seinfeld-like, sitcom-like Nothing, Forever. Using generative, machine-learning technologies such as DALL-E, OpenAI GPT-3, Stable Diffusion, and others, the resulting video makes for an awkward Xerox of Larry Davids 90s sitcom. Theres an Elaine (dubbed Yvonne Torres), a George (Fred Kastopolous), a Kramer (Zoltan Kakler), and, of course, a Jerry (Larry Feinberg), all of whom live in what appears to be a New York-esque metropolis.\n\n\nBut while the show bears an obvious resemblance to Seinfeld, it doesnt retain its charm or comedy. In fact, its not just awkward, its bizarre and uncanny. It looks like a rejected PS1 voxel game, the characters flop about when they move, the camera angles are strangely placed with some of the weirdest zoom-ins Ive ever seen, and the writing is pretty flat. Makes sense, considering the entire thing was made using artificial intelligence.\n\nTheres even a stand-up comedy portion, just like in Seinfeld, and laugh tracks that attempt to reinforce the supposed punchlines. At one point during the show, Larry made this joke about animals eating clowns, asking the crowd why such a thing might happen. Because they taste funny, Larry quipped. There was a long bit of silencecustomary for Nothing, Foreverbefore the laugh track briefly popped in, only to be cut short by the even more awkward transitional music. And because this is an endless, AI-generated show, none of these jokes are likely to ever appear again.\n\n\nBut maybe thats why I, and some 3,000 other people at the time of this writing, cant stop watching Mismatch Medias Nothing, Forever. Its weird, sure, but its also alluring in its unsettling production. Everything in the show is stiff and artificial. The voice acting especially is rough around the edges. Still, Nothing, Forever has this strange ability to capture my attention as I watch discount Jerry and friends stand around the apartment, often talking about nothing between spates of empty silence.\n\n\nRead More:Rick And Morty Creator Used Controversial AI Art, Voice Acting In New Shooter\n\nThe idea that technology can endlessly generate 90s-style sitcoms is undeniably novel. That said, as with other recent intersections of AI and media, this machine-generated content feels like a possibly slippery slope that has the potential to uproot entire careers, creative or otherwise.\n\nIn an email exchange with Kotaku, co-creator Skyler Hartle said he and his co-creator Brian Habersberger have been working on the passion project part-time for the past four years with a team of between three to seven people. With all of the AI tools at their disposal, including Azure Cognitive Services for voice generation, Hartle thinks the team can spin up new shows or formats.\n\nThe idea started out as an art projecta generative show that created nothing, forever, that people could tune into, Hartle said. As creators, we thought it was a really interesting [and] novel space to explore conceptually, but pretty early on, we started to recognize the potential for creating a platform in addition to the show that would help facilitate the creation of these kinds of generative media. When we started, ChatGPT/GPT-3/Stable Diffusion didnt exist, but with the advances that have happened very recently, its looking more and more likely that these types of shows are going to be one path into the future.\n\nTaking inspiration from David Lynchs 2002 short horror anthology Rabbits, Hartle said the team wanted to create something that would run forever, seeing 90s sitcoms as the perfect medium to target. The channel, Hartle noted, is steadily growing, with the chat being one of the best parts largely due to the memes folks have been sharing. Hartle hopes that the show and AI tech enable creators while having little to no negative impact on TV creation.\n\nOur goal with this project and our platform is to enable more creators, not less, Hartle said. We want people who have limited resources to be able to realize their creative visions, and we think this kind of technology is going to be a backbone for this.\n\nDespite enjoying the absurdity that is Nothing, Forever, I remain wary that artificial intelligence technologies could have a negative influence on not just the arts but the world as a whole. If used appropriately and sparingly, AI just might make life a little easier at times. However, because capitalists want to increase production as much as possible while spending as little money as possible, I worry that the writing is on the wall for at least some types of artists and other creatives who currently make a living through their art. Nothing, Forever is definitely neat, but you have to wonder where this sort of thing might eventually lead."

    "body": "extraordinarily popular ChatGPT\n. Getting the band back together, the researchers led by Google Brain researcher Nicholas Carlini found that both Googles Imagen and the popular open source Stable Diffusion were capable of reproducing images, some of which had obvious implications against image copyright or licenses.\nThe first image in that tweet was generated using the caption listed on Stable Diffusions dataset, the multi-terabyte scraped image database known as LAION. The team fed the caption into the Stable Diffusion prompt, and out came the same exact image, though slightly distorted with digital noise. The process for finding these duplicate images was relatively simple. The team ran the same prompt multiple times, and after getting that same resulting image, the researchers manually checked if the image was in the training set.\nG/O Media may get a commission\n:\nCornell University/Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models\nTwo of the papers researchers Eric Wallace, a PHD student at UC Berkeley, and Vikash Sehwag, a PHD candidate at Princeton University, told Gizmodo in a Zoom interview that image duplication was rare. Their team tried out about 300,000 different captions, and only found a .03% memorization rate. Copied images were even rarer for models like Stable Diffusion that have worked to de-duplicate images in its training set, though in the end, all diffusion models will have the same issue, to a greater or lesser degree. The researchers found that Imagen was fully capable of memorizing images that only existed once in the data set.\nAdvertisement\nThe caveat here is that the model is supposed to generalize, its supposed to generate novel images rather than spitting out a memorized version, Sehwag said.\nTheir research showed that as the AI systems themselves get bigger and more sophisticated, theres more likelihood AI will generate copied material. A smaller model like Stable Diffusion simply does not have the same amount of storage space to store most of that training data. That\n.\nAdvertisement\nMaybe in next year, whatever new model comes out thats a lot bigger and a lot more powerful, then potentially these kinds of memorization risks would be a lot higher than they are now, Wallace said.\nThrough a complicated process that involves destroying the training data with noise before removing that same distortion, Diffusion-based machine learning models create datain this case, imagessimilar to what it was trained on. Diffusion models were an evolution from the generative adversarial networks, or GAN-based machine learning.\nAdvertisement\nThe researchers found that GAN-based models do not have the same problem with image memorization, but its unlikely that major companies will move on beyond Diffusion unless an even more sophisticated machine learning model comes around that produces even more realistic, high quality images.\nFlorian Tramr, a computer science professor at ETH Zurich who participated in the research, noted how many AI companies advise that users, both those in free and paid versions, are granted license to share or even monetize the AI-generated content. The AI companies themselves also reserve some of the rights to these images. This could prove a problem if the AI generates an image that is exactly the same as an existing copyright.\nAdvertisement\nWith only a .03% rate of memorization, AI developers could look at this study and determine theres not much of a risk. Companies could work to de-duplicate images in the training data, which would make it less likely to memorize. Hell, they could even develop AI systems that would detect if an image is a direct replication of an image in training data and flag it for deletion. However, it masks the full risk to privacy posed by generative AI. Carlini and Tramr also assisted on\nthat argued that even attempts to filter data still does not prevent training data from leaking out through the model.\nAdvertisement\nAnd of course, theres a high risk that images nobody would want recopied end up showing up on users screens. Wallace asked if a researcher wanted to generate a whole host of synthetic medical data of peoples X-Rays, for example. What should happen if a diffusion-based AI memorizes\nand duplicates a persons actual medical records?\nIt is pretty rare, so you might not notice its happening at first, and then you might actually deploy this dataset on the web, the UC Berkeley student said. The goal of this work is to kind of preempt those possible sorts of mistakes that people might make."

Inclusion of 5G labs in the Budget will help youth and industry to develop new use cases of 5G. The aim is to make India a major exporter of telecom technology in the next 2-3 years, communications minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. Also ReadNew Income Tax Slab Budget 2023 Live Updates & Highlights: Tax rebate hiked, slabs reduced For AI, 2023 is a watershed year. AI talent has the highest concentration in India than anywhere else in the world. These AI centres of excellence will help provide service delivery and facilities, Vaishnaw added. Currently, telecom operators Jio and Airtel have expanded 5G services to over 250 cities. Setting up labs is a good idea but I think the impact of something like this will be marginal. It is difficult to see how this will change retail users perception of 5G value, beyond faster data speeds, said Mahesh Uppal, director at ComFirst (India), a telecom policy consulting organisation. We feel that the governments support for this (telecom) industry is crucial, especially when 5G is slated to be an enabler for several other verticals - for increasing efficiencies and output across various applications and use casesin our pursuit of achieving Industry 4.0, said SP Kochhar, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). Last month, Jio had also signed an agreement with Bhubaneswar-based SOA University to set up 5G lab. Apart from the focus on telecom and AI, the government also emphasised on the contribution of electronics especially smartphones to the countrys growth.In a bid to further lower the stress on the industry players, the government made announcements like removal of custom duty of 2.75% on components of mobile phones like camera lens, continuation of concessional duty on lithium-ion cells for batteries for another year, and reduction of basic customs duty on parts of open cells of TV panels to 2.5% from 5.5%.

Including relief on the custom duty of certain parts and inputs will reduce the overall price to 1-1.1% for a mobile phone as per us, said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint. According to Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of ICEA, there are significant gaps in the Budget and the government did not address the sectors genuine request like capping of basic customs duty on import of high-end mobile phones to arrest the growing smuggled market, removal of duty on certain parts of charger, and other essential components. Owing to weak domestic demand, the industry would fall short of its mobile phone manufacturing target in 2022-23. In the last financial year, the industry manufactured smartphones worth Rs 2.75 trillion."

It leverages data from IBM's Watson supercomputer to balance its portfolio, which has been quietly beating the market so far in 2023. Its factsheet shows most holdings are in the IT, healthcare, industrials, consumer discretionary, and financials sectors.\n\"We use AI with everything from maps to shopping and health screens, so to think it's not going to become a larger part of the investment space is a little bit misguided,\" Natividad told Insider. \"It's happening.\"\nSince OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November, the language bot has demonstrated its ability to write articles and even dating-app messages, sparking a stampede for artificial intelligence stocks.\nMeanwhile, the AI Powered Equity ETF, which holds 210 assets in its portfolio, has gained popularity, with average volume soaring to 90,000 over the last five days from 10,000 previously.\nCurrent investors have also expanded their positions and new investors have bought into the fund over the last month, Natividad said, adding that the algorithms behind the ETF are still learning.\n\"The increase in assets, and increase in different trades, make an impact,\" he said. \"These tools are improving, and the operators that are using the algorithms are improving.

    "body": "Twitch\nScreenshot by Gamepur\nThe plot of an ongoing Twitch stream is inspired by the 90s sitcom Seinfeld. Nothing Forever is an ongoing show that centers around a group of four individuals living in current-day New York City. The source material is pulled straight from the popular comedy show starring Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer and its all put together by an AI.\nNothing Forever is pitched as a show about nothing that happens forever. If that sounds familiar, Seinfeld is often described as a show about nothing. While the real-life series may have ended in 1998, Nothing Forever seems to have no end in sight. The show is streamed through the Twitch channel watchmeforever and has been running 24 hours a day since starting in December 2022.\nThe plot is, well, there doesnt seem to be a coherent storyline as the entire show is run by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. All of the lines the characters speak to each other are written by OpenAIs GPT-3. The creators say that nearly all generated content you hear, see, and experience while watching Nothing Forever is handled completely by AI. This is true aside from any artwork and laugh tracks.\nThe characters are based on the four main stars of Seinfeld but their names have been changed. Jerry is now Larry, George is Fred, Elaine is Yvonne, and Kramer is Kakler. They spend their time in various locations such as Larrys apartment or the comedy club. Theyll walk around the room talking to each other but will comically speak directly to walls or walk into a random corner when doing so. To add to the humor, a laugh track will be thrown in every now and again, even when it has no point in being there. Youll hear everything from conversations about creating tofu pet food, standup at a comedy club, and characters discussing their day-to-day lives.\nIt plays out like a standard episode of any sitcom and is quite entertaining. It bounces around from scene to scene with characters talking about various topics. None of it is connected but each scene contains some quirky humor, a laugh track, and everyday conversation that typically ends in a joke.\nSkyler Hartle, the creator of Nothing Forever, says the show is run off of GPT-3 extensively. If the Twitch stream ever drops or something malfunctions with the system, the development team says its more likely a 503 error. Hartle is working on finding ways to improve how errors are handled so the stream runs more smoothly without dropping."

    "body": "More article by this Writer\nJust a couple days ago, I spoke to ChatGPT, the revolutionary artificial intelligence chatbot everyone is gushing about.\nYes, it was beyond impressive watching the bot produce concise pieces of writing on any given topic with relevant info extracted from mostly English-language sources on the web within seconds. It even spilled out a nice short story about AI and aliens as soon as I asked for it.\nIt may soon be practically pointless for humans to write simple articles, solve math problems or write computer code, other than for learning purposes, because AI is better and so much faster.\nBut I also found one area that AI would never beat us in: making people laugh.\nWhen I asked the bot, developed by OpenAI, to tell its funniest joke, it responded: \"Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing.\"\nI demanded it do better, but it just churned out a couple more jokes that might make a third grader giggle.\nAs the world fears that AI might steal most of our jobs, I had thought the only worthwhile activity left for humans in the end may be performances using the human body like dance, sports or acrobatics.\nBut of course, the subtle art of saying something startlingly hilarious, but not totally unexpected, at the right moment is something only humans with high emotional intelligence can do.\nThe bot admitted: No, I cannot be funnier than humans. Humor is subjective and often depends on personal experiences, cultural background and individual sense of humor. I can provide jokes, but my humor might not always resonate with everyone.\nIt's hard to tell. If the likes of Larry Page, Sergey Brin or Elon Musk for some reason decide to develop a bot committed to cracking people up, it may reach a level that threatens or discourages humorists and comedians.\nBut tech whizzes are unlikely to do that because humans normally dont start a costly and difficult task unless there is a good reason. The point of having AI bots -- or any robot -- is to make them do things we dont want to do so we can spend more time on what we enjoy. Making people laugh falls in the latter category. Theres no way humans would give that joy away to machines.\nAs we hone our comedic skills to maintain a competitive edge over AI, we should also look at how these bots will affect our lives and our childrens lives in the near future.\nThe most immediate impact of ChatGPT is to be felt in the world of education.\nAlthough OpenAI said its working on digitally watermarking ChatGPTs output to help detect AI-generated text in students essays, there will soon be other chatbots and apps to get around that. So instead of focusing on policing AI-assisted cheating, tech experts advise teachers to utilize it as a new learning tool.\nTeachers, for example, can let students use ChatGPT to create outlines for their essays, and then have them write the essays longhand in class without their laptops or phones. Kids can also use it as a tutor or debate partner. Another way it could be used is as a tool for nurturing students critical thinking, as AI reflects human biases and prejudices, experts say.\nKoreans are lucky in a way because we still have some time before a Korean-language bot of this caliber will be developed.\nUntil then, we can observe how educators and students in English-speaking countries adapt to this new wave of change, and prepare ourselves to use it to our benefit.\nFor now, a simple interaction with ChatGPT would be enough to give us a reality check on the state of Korean education.\nThe developed world has moved on to curricula that help students do this through essays and debates, but Koreans are still harassing children and teenagers by making them learn things years ahead of their grade to later focus on technical training for specific exams.\nFor instance, private cram schools, known as hagwon, teach students tricks to find answers on the multiple-choice Suneung  Koreas College Scholastic Ability Test -- without spending too much time to understand the passages, some of which feel incomprehensible even for adults. For math, kids review as many types of questions as possible so when they see test questions, they know how to solve it from memory.\nBut this is what AI does best.\nAs future supervisors and commanders of AI, we need to foster independent thinkers who can construct their own ideas based on knowledge, effectively communicate them and connect the dots to make good judgments.\nIts likely that humans with a knack for inducing laughter are likely to be in greater demand than those who can crack Suneung questions.\nBecause even in the AI-powered future, humans will always love those who make them laugh.\nBy Kim So-hyun ("

    "body": "Castle Rock Entertainment/Courtesy Everett Collection\nThe sitcom about nothing has now entered the metaphysical realm.\n\nSeinfeld\n has now found new life thanks to AI platform co-creators Skyler Hartle and Brian Habersberger founding Nothing, Forever, a show that parodies the Emmy-winning series by running nonstop on Twitch. Nothing, Forever debuted December 14 and features the likenesses of Seinfeld characters Elaine, Jerry, George, and Kramer complete with a laugh track and algorithm-generated dialogue.\nIts an AI generated sitcomabout nothing, a TikTok teaser describes the show.\nAs generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, youre gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want, co-creator Hartle told Vices Motherboard. You dont just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.\nRelated\nOscars 2023: Best Costume Design Predictions\nHe added, Our grounding principle was, can we create a show that can generate entertaining content forever? Because thats truly where we see the future emerging towards. Our goal with the next iterations or next shows that we release is to actually trade a show that is like Netflix-level quality.\nThe dialogue for Nothing, Forever is powered by OpenAIs GPT-3 language model. The dialogue and direction of scenes is entirely generated through the AI platform. The show can also change based on Twitch users feedback through the stream chat. So, will the best jokes of Seinfeld be recreated on the AI version?\nThe show can effectively change and the narrative actually evolves based on the audience, Hartle said. One of the major factors that were thinking about is how do we get people involved in crafting the narrative so it becomes their own.\nLike Seinfeld, a Jerry-inspired character named Larry (presumably after series creator Larry David) performs stand-up comedy to cap off certain scenes, which was a mainstay for the show.\nThe actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project, co-creator Hartle said. But then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.\n@motherboardvice"

    "body": ") paid for Figma was crazy in a high-interest rate environment, Microsoft's valuation suggests it believes the transformative impact of ChatGPT could be enormous.\nBefore we carry on further and discuss the recent hype driving C3.ai (\nNYSE:\nAI\n) stock higher, investors need to note that C3 has always been an AI-first company.\nC3 has turnkey enterprise AI solutions to help customers build their AI applications across different industries, focusing on predictive analytics.\nNotably, CEO Tom Siebel believes that company CEOs in the future will need to provide clear, forward-looking insights to their board instead of backward-looking operating performance.\nAs such, we aren't surprised that Siebel announced that C3 will integrate ChatGPT into its new product suite, aptly termed \"\nC3 Generative AI\nProduct Suite.\"\nAs part of the initial launch, the company will focus on delivering the Enterprise Search product, which \"provides a natural language interface for enterprise users to search, retrieve and present relevant data across all information systems.\"\nIs this important? Absolutely.\nkiller use cases\n\" for ChatGPT could be in enterprise knowledge management.\nHe articulated that advanced AI models like ChatGPT could transform how knowledge is stored and structured. Accordingly, companies could leverage Generative AI to access and interact with the knowledge that was previously \"stored in flat, two-dimensional way.\"\nAs such, Generative AI could compel companies to adopt it rapidly to maintain their competitive edge.\nHence, with the AI hype in vogue now, C3 is astute to capitalize on ChatGPT's abilities and incorporate advanced AI models into its solutions.\nDespite that, investors must remember that C3 is still an unprofitable company. Moreover, the revised consensus estimates suggest that C3 is not expected to report a positive adjusted EBIT margin through FY25 (year ending April 2025).\nMoreover, with the switch from a subscription-based to a consumption-based pricing model, its revenue is expected to experience higher volatility, even though it should help to accelerate adoption.\nDespite that, we believe there's a significant level of execution risk implied in an operating model that still needs to prove its profitability, which is not likely a top priority right now for Siebel. He articulated:\nI mean I can be profitable this quarter. Okay. I only have one cost. It's human capital. So I do a big layoff and I'm probably cash positive and profitable that -- would that be in the best interest of our shareholders? No freaking way, okay? We'd be trading off future growth to make some analysts or one shareholder happy, okay? (\n)\nAI price chart (weekly) (TradingView)\nAI has recovered significantly from its December lows, up more than 110% through this week's highs. The vertical rocket-esque surge also sent AI close to its August highs as investors lifted AI-first stocks.\nIs the recovery sustainable? We believe C3 needs to convince us that its new pricing model is sustainable, with a clear path toward profitability.\nHowever, Generative AI packs a lot of promise and could transform C3's go-to-market momentum if integrated well into its turnkey solutions.\nMuch depends on how Siebel and his team execute from here.\nStill, a pullback is well overdue, coupled with AI's price action. Hence, investors are urged to avoid joining the hype train now.\nRating: Hold (Reiterated).\nAre you looking to strategically enter the market and optimize gains?\nUnlock the key to successful growth stock investments with our expert guidance on identifying lower-risk entry points and capitalizing on them for long-term profits.

    "body": "Challenges\nListed below are some of the obstacles AI faces in the agriculture industry:\nFarmers must understand that artificial intelligence is a more advanced data processing, gathering, and monitoring field. AI necessitates a robust technological infrastructure. Even farms equipped with some technology may fail to advance.\nIt is also an issue for software companies. They should begin by introducing farmers to technology through an agro-trade platform. After farmers have grown accustomed to a more straightforward solution, it will be suitable to incorporate AI functions.\nFarmers may face problems due to privacy and security threats like cyberattacks and data leaks.\nFarmers and agribusiness owners eager to implement innovative solutions must receive training and continuing support from corporations.\nFurthermore, all problems in implementing AI in agriculture are solvable. However, for the time being, technology providers must consider three things:\nHow to improve their tools?\nHow to assist farmers in addressing their concerns?\nHow to readily and understandably express that machine learning helps solve genuine problems, such as lowering manual labour?\nAI applications in healthcare\nIndia has only 64 practicing doctors per 100,000 individuals, but the global average is roughly 150 per 100,000. Rural primary health centres and sub-centres are frequently understaffed and need essential infrastructure to address patient needs. In addition, it often results in the absence of high-quality diagnostic services, especially in rural India, where over 70 percent of the population resides.\nThe Indian government-affiliated think tank NITI Aayog is currently validating the use of AI as a screening tool in eyecare by comparing its diagnostic accuracy to that of retina specialists. In addition, NITI Aayog has been testing the application of AI in primary care for the early detection of diabetes complications. Expanding the capacity for eye exams and early detection, as well as enabling access in remote locations across the nation, is possible by integrating AI capabilities with portable screening devices like 3Nethra.\nSimilarly, oncology might use tools like this as well. For example, the Comprehensive Archive of Imaging, India's first de-identified cancer picture collection, was introduced by Tata Medical Center and the Indian Institute of Technology. AI-based tools can use high-quality de-identified photos to help machine-learning models find biomarkers and enhance the results of cancer research.\nAlso read:\nAirtel, Apollo Hospitals conduct 5G-based tech trial for colon cancer detection\nSimilarly, Microsoft's AI Network for Healthcare and Apollo Hospitals are building a machine learning model to forecast better heart attack risk in cardiovascular healthcare, a significant and rather unique challenge for India. The AI solution may uncover new risk factors and provide patients with a cardiac risk score without a thorough physical examination, enabling early illness identification, using clinical and lab data from over 400,000 patients.\nThe following are some of the most exciting AI advancements now impacting the healthcare industry:\nAccurate Cancer Diagnosis\nEarly Identification of Fatal Blood Disorders\nCustomer Support Chatbots\nImproved Access to Healthcare\nChallenges\nIn adopting AI in healthcare, there needs to be more standardization. Unfortunately, there are currently no agreed-upon standards for the usage of AI in healthcare settings. This lack of standardization can be problematic for both healthcare providers and patients.\nIt can be challenging for healthcare providers to distinguish between effective and ineffective AI applications. It can result in wasted time and resources spent on unsuccessful AI applications. Patients may need clarification and clarity over the quality of care they receive when there is a need for more standardization. Patients may be reluctant to adopt AI applications if they lack confidence in their efficacy.\nAI applications in sustainable cities\nIndia is currently experiencing an urbanization boom. The percentage of the population living in urban areas was projected to be 31 percent in 2011; however, a recent study based on satellite data indicates that this number is already close to 45 percent and is expected to reach 60 percent by 2050, according to the document. Moreover, Unplanned urbanization is a crucial component of a country's economic progress. Still, it frequently results in congestion, over-pollution, high crime rates, and low living conditions. In addition, it may strain the infrastructure and administrative requirements of existing Indian cities.\nIn 2008, IBM presented smart cities as a solution to urbanization's challenges by developing a new urban environment designed for performance and growth. In a \"smart city\" based on the digital city's infrastructure and promising environmentally friendly architecture and cutting-edge technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) will monitor all aspects of life. IoT creates a seamless cyber-physical landscape by connecting digital and physical cities.\nThe following are some of the most intriguing advances in artificial intelligence now impacting sustainable cities:\nEnvironmental\nAnticipating Future Demands\nChallenges\nIn general, AI networks function through surveillance cameras and sensors. This high-tech equipment necessitates a substantial expense, mainly when used for public functions. This equipment also requires routine maintenance, resulting in recurring costs. Therefore, a proper implementation plan is necessary to estimate future expenditures and optimize initial costs. Despite the seemingly high cost, AI technology improves the efficiency of smart city procedures over time. In addition, it increases income, which quickly covers the startup and operating costs.\nSometimes, natural disasters such as a hurricane might harm AI equipment placed in the open. Depending on its location and accessibility, this equipment may also be subject to theft. Moreover, these accidents would increase the cost of equipment repair or replacement. Therefore, it is vital to plan setup places so that they are both sheltered from the elements and difficult to access.\nOf course, there will be obstacles, but with everyone pitching in, we can make significant progress toward these goals.\nInvite your friends and family to sign up for MC Tech 3, our daily newsletter that breaks down the biggest tech and startup stories of the day\nDAILY-EVENING\nSUBSCRIBE"
