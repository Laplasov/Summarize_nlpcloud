So the company is debuting a paid ChatGPT Plus service, which will launch in the coming weeks.\nChatGPT will cost $20 per month, but dont despair. OpenAI says that it still plans to offer a free version of ChatGPT as well.\nIf youve used ChatGPT before, you know how crazy powerful the chatbot can be. ChatGPT can write code, poetry, and short stories alike, and construct philosophical as well as logical arguments. Its so powerful, in fact, that students have begun using it for their assignments, prompting a debate about whether it should be considered an assistive tool, like a calculator, or an actual cheat. (A tool OpenAI developed to identify AI-generated text has some problems.)\nThe problem is that all of the demand for ChatGPT has made it increasingly difficult to access. The site frequently generates error messages reporting that the site is too congested to use. Even when ChatGPT is accessible, it can be slow to respond or generate responses. OpenAI said in a blog post that ChatGPT Plus will feature general access to ChatGPT, even during peak times, as well as faster response times. OpenAI said that it will use the paid access to test out new services, too.\nNot surprisingly, ChatGPT users have helped train the AI further.\nWe launched ChatGPT as a research preview so we could learn more about the systems strengths and weaknesses and gather user feedback to help us improve upon its limitations. Since then, millions of people have given us feedback, weve made several"

Internationally, ChatGPT is banned in school districts across the US, France, and India.\nChatGPT\n(and similar technology) is part of a new wave of AI that can generate highly cohesive, human-like responses to questions and prompts. ChatGPT continues to be criticised because of concerns about student learning and the potential for plagiarism.\nInternational expert in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and education, UniSAs Professor George Siemens, says generative AI will create opportunities for teachers.\nChatbots, such as ChatGPT, are innovations that are here to stay. But rather than avoiding or banning them, its far more beneficial for teachers to explore and experiment with them to get a better sense of what is possible, Prof George Siemens says.\nFor example, if you ask ChatGPT to produce a sample lesson plan for grade 5 algebra, the platform creates a set of objectives, any materials youll need, plus a range of suitable activities for students at that maths level. Or if youre teaching programming, ChatGPT can create and debug code.\nIf youre a teacher, you can see how this tool could help you plan, generate ideas, and organise your weekly lessons. Importantly it frees time for you to connect and engage with your students so that you can create more personal and meaningful learning opportunities.\nTeaching is rapidly changing. By embracing new technologies, and learning how AI can complement teaching, we can prepare students for a future where they will be able to compete with the best and brightest.\nAs teaching innovations grow in sophistication and complexity, Prof Siemens says it will be vital for assessment and teaching models to keep up.\nExisting assessment models that only test the product, but not the process of learning, will not fare well under an AI-shaped future, Prof Siemens says.\nWe already know that managing AI for out-of-class assignments could be challenging, but perhaps its indicative of the need to change traditional assessment models so that they better match modern learning needs?\nProf Siemens says that AI can help reduce teacher administration, boost personalised learning experiences for students, and encourage real-world knowledge application. But to do so, the education sector must be open to change.\nWe are on the cusp of a massive explosion of innovation and creativity in the education sector and AI is at the very centre of it, Prof Siemens says.\nTeachers must start connecting with their peers around the impact of AI on their teaching; schools will need to advise parents about how theyre using AI in the classroom; school leadership teams must consider future options for professional development for their staff; and State and national education departments should be actively evaluating how AI will affect policy, technology needs, and teachers supports.\nAI presents a tremendous new technology that opens a whole new opportunity for knowledge generation and idea creation to improve teaching practices.\nThis convergence of humans and AI working together is the future. Getting started now will ensure teachers and students build the familiarity they need to excel in this new space.\n"

Finance\non Wednesday.\nKelman said generative text composition technology, like that built into the buzzy ChatGPT, is proving helpful for agents who struggle with crafting well-written sentences.\nNot all the people who go into real estate are William Shakespeare, and so they struggle with just composing an email thats grammatically correct, Kelman said. And if you give ChatGPT just a few facts about whats going on with this customer, you get a nice email on the other side.\nChatGPT\n, a text-generating app powered by generative artificial intelligence, was recently made available for public use. Users enter simple prompts including the style of writing they would like and all relevant information, and the program spits out a piece of text for them.\nThe spread of the program has sparked conversations about its potential for online marketing, as well as raised ethical questions for its potential use by students for completing assignments.\nKelman predicted AI products will continue to infiltrate all aspects of online text-based marketing, and should prove particularly useful for those who struggle with writing.\nMore people are going to use it to create content when theyre not good writers themselves, he said. Theyre just like my fifth grader whos trying to figure out how to get a term paper done.\nKelman also used his appearance on the program to talk about the housing market, which he said provided reasons for optimism during January as mortgage rates receded from their highs and buyers gradually returned to the market.\nAs rates have fallen from 7 percent in November to roughly 6 percent now, purchase applications, tour requests, and offers have all increased, and agents are starting to report offer deadlines and bidding wars on well-priced homes for the first time in months, and regular homebuyers are taking advantage of investors bowing out of the higher-rate market, Kelman said.\nInvestors used to bid for those properties and blow out our customers, he said. The investors are mostly on the sideline right now. So people are starting to creep back into the market. There are a few places where weve seen 10, 20 offers on a home, which was absolutely out of the question in the fourth quarter.\nKelman said he expects conditions to keep improving, as long as mortgage rates dont increase again.\nThere are a few reasons for optimism, Kelman said. Were not out of the woods yet. But the market significantly improved in January. It was a very weak market in Q4. Its significantly better now in January. Time will tell if rates are going to stay down."

But what exactly?\nHome search has already been transformed by some ho-hum AI applications. Recommendation engines being the most familiar, rendering house choices that better fit your needs and dreams. Your priorities during the house hunt will be baked into search results, including your personal preferences for nearby shops, amenities and safety. Seamless.\nSay hello to your personal lifestyle and home curator.\nFilters will be less important as the chatbot knows you better than you know yourself.\nAlso, expect transaction automation to get a lift like interactive smart contracts.

Insight on who will buy or sell when, and where the market might be headed. Conceptually old news, but now with better accuracy.\nWe should make progress automating data population from overlapping but disconnected datasets. AI machinery excels at complex math and memory skills. These reforms are already in motion as AI and the blockchain dance well together, like Baryshnikov and Kirkland.\nInformation, granular and high level, will permeate everything. But its ubiquitous characteristics will now be integrated into your life, without you asking for it.\nAI makes you smarter than you are.\nPractically speaking, generative artificial intelligence, which describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT), can be used to create new content, including audio, images, simulations and videos.\nSince much of real estate is about marketing, expect a lurch in creative new content about listings, neighborhoods and lifestyles, as words give way to images, 3D and enhanced virtual experiences.\nThe end game: Consumers will be better informed, doing much of your job themselves. With AI, DIY is getting a boost, as companies pass their work onto the public.\nLook no further than customer service. Its awash in do-it-yourself applications, without a human hand. With digital help, companies have decided to let you figure out their product and services on your own. Egads.\nIdeally, some of this should lead to faster and more efficient transactions. Agents should have more time to focus on the tough stuff and be less burdened by the mundane.\nPlus, home shopping will be more fun, fulfilling and multidimensional, supercharging homebuyer enthusiasm.\nTechnology is notorious for over-promising, and you can expect some lame and broken products along the way. And be wary of vendors who pitch AI, selling you duck-taped solutions that do nothing to improve your life."

    "body": "(NASDAQ: META)\n. These stocks were big losers in 2022, but that's why they might be able to deliver impressive returns from here. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are continuing to invest in new products and technologies to drive more growth.\nNvidia\nShare prices of the leading graphics processing unit (GPU) supplier rallied at the end of 2022 after a brutal sell-off last year. One reason to consider buying the stock on the dip is Nvidia's leading position in one very important market to the global economy.\nNvidia sells chip hardware and systems to enterprises in the burgeoning data center market. These GPU accelerators are mission critical for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to process massive data workloads. Spending on data centers is only going to grow over time as AI becomes widely adopted for everything from oil exploration to chatbots.\nNvidia is also a leader in gaming, which is a big reason the stock fell last year. Gaming is the company's second-largest revenue source after data center. Lower demand for gaming GPUs led to oversupply in the retail channels, which will take a few quarters to work through. This is why gaming revenue was cut in half last quarter, causing Nvidia's total revenue to decline 17% over the year-ago quarter.\nNvidia has been through these demand cycles before, but it's important to keep the long-term growth trajectory in perspective. Consider that Nvidia's $5.9 billion in total revenue last quarter was double the same quarter five years ago. It's this long-term growth trajectory that should keep the stock climbing higher over the long term.\nYCharts\nThere are several growth catalysts to watch this year.\nFirst, Nvidia is preparing to launch its RTX 40-series gaming chips for laptops. Gaming demand could be bottoming out right now. The recent launch of the GeForce RTX 4090 for consumer PCs sold out quickly, which shows a solid floor of demand in the gaming market.\nPlus the company is launching the new Hopper chip architecture for data centers, which is designed to handle the latest types of data workloads.\nNvidia is also set to launch the \"Grace\" central processing unit (CPU). This positions Nvidia to go after the $30 billion server CPU market, which was dominated by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. For Nvidia, Grace rounds out an impressive offering of data center products across GPUs, CPUs, data processing units (DPUs), networking equipment, and software, which combined means a $300 billion addressable market.\nNvidia should bounce back\n. It provides the technological backbone of artificial intelligence and recommendation systems, which are pivotal to e-commerce and many other industries in the economy. Investors who buy the stock at these lower share prices should earn a great return on their investment.\nMeta Platforms\nShare prices of Meta Platforms are down 50% over the last year as advertisers held back on spending in the face of uncertainty in the economy. Social media platforms have also had a difficult time navigating around the effects Apple's privacy changes on iOS have had on ad tracking. These headwinds contributed to a sluggish year of growth.\nDespite revenue falling 4% year over year in the third quarter, engagement across Meta's family of apps is still strong. Meta's social media platforms now reach over 3.7 billion people every month. That is a massive pool of users that brands will want to connect with.\nMeta is investing billions in AI to make its platform more valuable to those advertisers. This should create better content recommendations across its apps, which in turn will translate to higher ad spending and revenue.\nThe company's capital expenditures in the third quarter were more than double the same quarter in 2019, driven by increased spending on AI capacity.\nYCharts\nThe increased spending is already showing signs of the effect it will have more broadly across the company down the road. For example, management previously reported that improved AI recommendations led to a 15% increase in watch time in Facebook Reels in the second quarter of last year.\nImprovements to the discovery engine using AI are a big opportunity to drive higher engagement and ad revenue. In the third quarter, there was a 50% increase in the number of played Reels compared to the previous six months. Management believed this represented a market share gain against top competitor TikTok.\nThese investments are widening the company's competitive moat and setting up the next leg of growth, including the moonshot opportunity the company has in the metaverse and virtual reality. With negative sentiment hovering over the stock, this is an ideal point to start building a position before better news sends the stock higher.\nFind out why Nvidia is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\nOur award-winning analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now.

    "body": "Bitcoin Magazine\n->\nAs artificial intelligence tools become more powerful and accessible, can they help more people get a grasp on Bitcoin?\nThis is an opinion editorial by Kroum Kroumov, a writer and editor with Bitcoin-focused venture design studio Peak Shift Ltd.\nBitcoin innovation is snowballing, with new projects being released every month. As excited as I am about this boom, I have to admit that its overwhelming to keep pace. But theres even more to be thrilled about in tech besides Bitcoin. More specifically, the release of the AI language model ChatGPT has already revolutionized research.\nThe potential of combining Bitcoin along with AI research got me thinking right away: Is the information that AI provides accurate? Are the sources relevant? Can AI keep up with the rapid development of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network?\nIn this article, I will explore the benefits and limitations of using AI when researching Bitcoin, drawing on my personal experience by highlighting the pluses as well as the minuses. Lets get into what I discovered!\nResearch Simplified By AI\nArtificial intelligence has changed the way we do research. I find this exciting, as it has the potential to onboard a plethora of people to Bitcoin through accessibility of information. AI algorithms sift through large amounts of data, automatically identify the most useful information and return it to you in clear and comprehensible language. This saves time and effort when looking for resources.\nWe have all experienced the agony of rummaging through blog posts and random articles, and we know how time consuming and confusing it can get. I remember the steep learning curve that I had to go through when first encountering Bitcoin. Why didnt I have AI to just bullet point it all for me by simply asking it a few questions?\nIn this way, AI can make general information about Bitcoin easier to understand and it can do so in almost any language. You can even ask it to clarify further and further! The result will be that the infamous learning curve of Bitcoin will become easier to understand for anyone, anywhere. With ease of understanding, we get wider adoption.\nOrganizing Information\nOne of AIs most distinguishing features is its ability to organize information in seconds. With the vast and growing amount of data already available about Bitcoin and Lightning, there couldnt be a more helpful tool than one that can put the information together. Ill admit that AI is now my 24-hour personal assistant. Its knowledgeable, fast and can spin text around anyway I ask it to. Yes, it can even give you sailor and Shakespearean talk.\nAI organizes and categorizes information, making it easier for users to find what they need, while presenting it how they want it presented. Some ways that we can do this is by asking the AI to extract the main points from a text, to create a study plan, to simplify the language, to translate, to clarify, to bullet-point an article, and the list goes on.\nOrganization and sorting are especially useful for researchers, investors, entrepreneurs, journalists, students and general learners who are trying to understand any aspect of the Bitcoin or the Lightning Network. For example, we can ask it to give us a list of resources and to prioritize them based on our importance criteria.\nLimitations Of AI research\nDespite the benefits, there are major limitations to consider when using AI for researching the Bitcoin network in 2023. One limitation is that insights provided by AI-powered tools may be less accurate or factually reliable than those of more traditional research methods. This is because ChatGPTs knowledge is limited to data up to 2021, and does not reflect more recent developments in Bitcoin or the Lightning Network. Lightning especially is undergoing a development boom with the rapid changes in technology and available tools. Just look at some of the recent Lightning hackathons that have taken place. Therefore, the AI timeframe limitation is a serious factor to consider.\nTaking into consideration builder events like hackathons, the development of Bitcoin and Lightning is very rapid. Even enthusiasts have trouble keeping up. There are developers working on Bitcoin all over the world and new resources and information are becoming available all the time. This rapid growth makes it difficult for AI systems to keep up, and anyone looking for current data and trends will need to look elsewhere.\nAnother limitation affecting AI is the open-source nature of Bitcoin and Lightning. AI has limited knowledge of independent, newly-hatched resources. Therefore, information provided by AI-powered tools will be more general and may not cover niche innovation within the network.\nAnd another thing thats missing is the lack of on-the-fly data. Getting a current, comprehensive picture of the network is not possible at this stage with AI. For investors and entrepreneurs, up-to-date and on-the-fly data are crucial. Fortunately, there are resources and tools outside of AI models that give live data for research. For visual and live Lightning Network research with graphs, maps and charts, you can try platforms like The Lightning Network Explorer or Amboss.\nFaulty Information\nFrom my research using AI, I found that there was false information coming in. This can be tricky. On first glance, the content might look great, but if you are an expert in the field, you will quickly see holes inside the text. This is why we still need a human that can fact check anything coming in from AI.\nFor example, when I asked ChatGPT for Lightning resources, it gave me a list, but I could not find all of the resources listed when I ran a Google search, which made me wonder whether some of these resources existed at all. Therefore, in 2023, this is another reason we need the human touch. We just cant fully trust you yet, AI.\nAI Is Promising, But There Is Work To Be Done\nIn summary, AI helps us research Bitcoin by providing general information, broadening learning opportunities, translating, explaining and organizing information. But the limitations of AI include limited resources, lack of data about smaller projects, unverified information and faulty resources\nThe extremely rapid development of Bitcoin and Lightning projects is something that AI cant keep up with because of its 2021 limit, AI has limited knowledge of independent niche innovation and live Bitcoin and Lightning Network data exploration is another area lacking in AI.\nUltimately, while AI simplifies research, its limited to more general information because it lacks up-to-date data on newer or lesser-known industry releases. Plus, as we stand, AI is restricted to information only up to 2021.\nWhen diving into Bitcoin research, I recommend starting with AI and moving on to more Bitcoin-specific tools for network exploration. Even using something like Wikipedia to double check the information, in case you know little about Bitcoin, will be helpful.\nOverall, use AI to organize and explain your information and to "

The protection services most outstanding feature is its scanning platform, which is powered by IBM Watson, an AI supercomputer that can analyze and learn fraud patterns to warn consumers if they are at high risk of identity theft.\nThe companys use of AI technology is what allows it to send alerts at record speeds. According to Power Consultings 2019 Review of Speed and Coverage Study, Identity Guard customers receive alerts within four minutes of a threat being identified, on average. The same study points out that the company also sends more alerts, on average  nearly 15% more than industry competitors , which keeps customers aware of their situation and consequently better protected.\nIndividual Plan\nCredit monitoring service and reports limited to one bureau on most plans\nPlan rates increases after the first year\nWhy we chose it: We chose LifeLock\nas the best identity theft protection for features because of the extensive cybersecurity software included in its plans.\nLifeLock by Norton is at its best when bundled with Norton 360, a cybersecurity suite designed to provide multiple layers of protection against existing and emerging cyber threats in a single software package. Norton360 includes antivirus and malware protection, parental controls, a password manager and a VPN for five or more devices  depending on your plan  as well as a cloud backup for Windows computers.\nLifeLocks basic plan is not as feature-packed compared to other identity theft services. However, its higher-tier plans include several monitoring services that are not commonly found in identity theft protection packages, such as social media monitoring, payday loan monitoring and bank account takeover alerts.\nAltogether, Lifelock is the identity theft protection of choice for those who are looking to stay as safe as possible online  just watch out for the services rate hike at the end of your first year.\nPaid Monthly\nHigher-priced family plans than its competitors\nMonitoring not included\nWhy we chose it: We chose IdentityForce as the best identity theft protection for comprehensive protection because its starting plan includes an extensive selection of monitoring types, alerts and cybersecurity tools.\nIdentityForce has two identity theft protection packages to choose from, and neither is particularly inexpensive (unless you find a discount). However, what the plans lack in affordability they more than make up for in features and services.\nThe companys Ultrasecure plan includes nearly everything IdentityForce has to offer, including a number of advanced features, such as sex offender monitoring, investment account alerts and medical ID fraud prevention services, that youd only see on more expensive packages.\nMeanwhile, its credit plan includes credit scores and reports from all three credit bureaus and a credit score simulator that you can use to evaluate how certain financial decisions might impact your score.\nIdentityForce is also a good choice if youre looking for child identity theft protection or a comprehensive bundle of credit services. Its ChildWatch add-on features ongoing identity monitoring, a smart SSN tracker and an award-winning social media identity monitoring suite.\nIndividual Plan\nThree-bureau credit monitoring only available on most expensive plan\nBase plan doesn't include credit monitoring services\nWhy we chose it: We chose ReliaShield as the best identity theft protection for family plans because it offers the greatest value for families due to its comprehensive and highly affordable group packages.\nReliaShield family plans cover two adults and start at $14.99 per month, whereas pricing for family identity monitoring plans usually starts at $25 per month. In addition to their competitive pricing, all plans feature five types of monitoring, data breach updates, 24/7 customer and recovery services, as well as wallet protection. All plans also cover children under 18 years for no extra charge, making it ideal for households with a large number of minors.\nReliaShield offers credit report reminders on its starting individual and family plans, but youll only find the real credit protection services on its mid and high-tier plans. These services include single or three-bureau credit monitoring, a monthly credit score tracker and credit card application notifications. The company also monitors neighborhood predators and social media, which are important types of protection for families. However, these features are not included on the Essential plan.\nIndividual Plan\nLow-cost plan for small budgets\nCons\nLimited identity monitoring services compared to competitors\nNo money back guarantee or free trial period\nWhy we chose it: We chose IdentityIQ as the best identity theft protection for credit monitoring because its wide variety of credit-related services is the most complete and available across most of its four plan tiers.\nIdentityIQ will be most effective for consumers whose main concern is their credit safety and health. Although the companys identity monitoring doesnt stand out, its plans all feature credit monitoring services and tracking in addition to essential identity theft monitoring. Higher tier plans also feature single or three-bureau monitoring, a credit score simulator and score change alerts.\nConsumers on a tighter budget may appreciate the companys wider range of plan options. Its Secure plan is only $6.99 per month  $5.94 with annual payment  and still offers daily credit monitoring and alerts from one credit agency along with dark web monitoring, Social Security number alerts, lost wallet assistance and up to $1 million to cover stolen funds.\nPaid Monthly\nNo detailed credit reports provided\nNo discounts on annual plans\nWhy we chose it: We chose IDShield as the best identity theft protection for restoration because of its combination of licensed private investigators and affordable three-bureau monitoring.\nIDShield is an easy pick as the go-to service for identity restoration due to its use of professional investigators, who will step in to track down the source(s) of fraud.

By Thursday morning, the channel rose to 47,000 followers and a steady stream of around 11,000 active viewers at once, making the show the first AI-generated sitcom with a growing audience.\nAdvertisement\nThe co-creators of the show, Skylar Hartle and Brian Habersberger, told Motherboard that they used a combination of machine learning, generative algorithms, and cloud services to build the show. This means that the characters are all speaking to each other using GPT-3, OpenAIs language model, which becomes clear as the characters are often not looking at each other when they are talking and rarely make sense.\nThere is something about this nonsense that reads to viewers as being humorous and interesting in an off-kilter way. The Twitch livestreams chat is constantly blowing up with peoples responses to the conversations the characters are having. Some people repeat interesting dialogue or express how scared they are when the characters are being meta or self-aware, or how theyre confused by the placement of laugh tracks after unfunny lines. ..... and ??? are commonly written in the chat.\nNothing, Forever is perhaps so good at retaining a steady stream of viewers because it is streaming non-stop, and has been since December 14.

The show is currently raking in more than 10000 viewers at any given time.\nCreated by Skylar Hartle and Brian Habersberger, Seinfelds spinoff was generated using a combination of machine learning, generative algorithms, and cloud services. This means that the characters are all speaking to each other using GPT-3, OpenAIs language model, which becomes clear as the characters are often not looking at each other when they are talking and rarely make sense. There is, however, a laughing track that supports the scenes.\nThe spinoff has now become a hit with the fans of the original. According to many viewers on Twitch, the running dialogue from fans is often funnier than the show, although some admit to confusion and fear of where this is all heading.\nNothing, Forever premiered on December 14."

Google, which has tried to be at the forefront of this segment, sees itself in need of vindicating itself. The CEO of Alphabet, Sundai Pichar, has taken advantage of the presentation of the results of the fourth quarter, somewhat lackluster, to ensure that the company is about to reveal a leap in the searches and other services of the group.\nAlphabet closed the year 2022 with record revenues of 282,836 million dollars (about 259,000 million euros at current exchange rates), 10% more than the previous year, as reported this Thursday. However, operating margins deteriorated and operating income fell 5% to $74.842 billion due to higher costs. Added to this was the loss in value of some investments and other non-operating losses. With all this, net profit fell 21% in the year as a whole, to 59,962 million dollars.\nHS Environment The new climate law is tightening from the current one - HS will show the press conference live at 1.30 pm\nIn the fourth quarter things were even worse. Profit fell 34%, to 13,624 million dollars, after billing grew less than 1%, to 76,048 million, penalized by the strength of the dollar. In addition, advertising revenue from Google and YouTube fell in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2021. The decline is 3.6%, up to 59,042 million. In the history of Google, it is only the second time that advertising billing has decreased and the first, in the second quarter of 2020, was due to the outbreak of the covid pandemic.\nPartly to make up for those lackluster results and partly in response to ChatGPT, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google,\nA vacation trip turns into a tragedy.. A Jordanian judge kills his wife and son\nChatGPT, a Microsoft ally, is perceived as a threat to Google. If it improves and becomes more widespread, users may prefer to ask questions to chat or other similar services instead of trying to find links through the search engine. Alphabet has announced that it will undertake changes to the way it reports results as a result of the rise of artificial intelligence.\nBoth Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat have referred to the cost structure review. Alphabet has announced 12,000 layoffs this year, the equivalent of 6% of the workforce. The figures published this Thursday show that the group created 33,734 jobs in 2022, which has added 71,000 in the last three years. It closed 2022 with 190,234 employees.\nThe Mountain View (California, United States) giant expects to incur employee severance payments and other related charges of $1.9 to $2.3 billion, most of which will be recognized in the accounts for the first quarter of 2023. In addition, it is taking steps to optimize its office space around the world, which will entail terminating and similar costs of approximately $500 million, also in the first quarter of this year."

But, its history actually dates back\nthousands of years.\nA new exhibit at the Museum of History and Science (MoSH) takes visitors on a trip through that history, as well as its future.\nIn our quest to showcase the people, places and things that make us proud to call the Mid-South home, were delving into Artificial Intelligence: Your Mind & the Machine.\nAccording to the Executive Director of the group that put the exhibit together, artificial intelligence is the most important technology on planet earth right now. HP Newquist heads up the Relayer Group -- a media and education company that put together the traveling exhibit.\nIts in our phones ... its Siri ... its GPSs that get us from one place to another ... the things that make recommendations to buy online ... And what this exhibit does ... it shows how not only A.I. does those things, but how it compares to the way we do them, Newquist explained.\nHe added that the exhibit is for all ages and is presented in an easy-to-understand format that focuses on the technology and its history -- from an ancient Greek legend about a mechanical man guarding an island to Frankensteins monster, which is a first-of-its-kind story about an artificially-created human.\nAs Newquist described, So, people will see where the origins of artificial came. But, then theyll start experiencing why artificial intelligence is different than human intelligence -- and its the way we perceive the world.\nVisitors can also interact with practical A.I. through puzzles, illusions and computers.\nAnd as they go through, theyll start to see more complicated versions or more complex versions of A.I., Newquist said.\nThe exhibit ends with some questions like:\nWhat do you think the future will be? How do you feel about it being a part of your life?\nSo, were really looking at not only historically, but technologically from start to finish, clarified Newquist.\nAlthough A.I. can do wonderful things for us, theres also a need for better understanding of the technology.\nIts not yet something that we need to be afraid of ... but it needs to be understood so that people can get a grasp on the future of working with this technology he advised.\nAnd the idea behind this exhibit is to prepare us for the future while exploring the past in a city were proud to call home.\nArtificial Intelligence: Your Mind & the Machine will be on display at MoSH, formally the Pink Palace Museum, through May 6.\nAnd this summer, the museum will host another exhibit by the Relayer Group, entitled America at the Crossroads, a Look at American History Through the Guitar."

But Washington has held its tongue, nudging the country on Russia while condoning Indias more hawkish stance on China.\nOn Monday, Sullivan and Doval participated in a Chamber of Commerce event with corporate leaders from Lockheed Martin, Adani Enterprises and Applied Materials.\nAlthough India is part of the Biden administrations signature Asian engagement project, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), it has opted against joining the IPEF trade pillar negotiations.\nThe initiative also includes a joint effort on space and high-performance quantum computing.\nGeneral Electric, meanwhile, is asking the U.S. government for permission to produce jet engines with India that would power aircraft operated and produced by India, according to the White House, which says a review is underway.\nNew Delhi said that the U.S. government would review General Electrics application expeditiously and that the two countries would focus on joint production of key items of mutual interest in defense.\nThe two countries also established a quantum technology coordination mechanism and agreed to set up a task force with Indias Semiconductor Mission, the India Electronics Semiconductor Association (IESA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) to promote the development of semiconductor ecosystems.\nIndias space program will work with NASA on human space flight opportunities and other projects, the Indian statement said."
