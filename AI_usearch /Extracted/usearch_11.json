But thus far, theres no real checking process in place, with Twitter instead relying on what it calls payment verification  i.e. bot accounts wont be able to pay, so they wont be able to sign-up to Twitter Blue, or itll be increasingly expensive for them to do so.\nThough that, seemingly, has not proven to be a real deterrent as yet.\nOver the last few months, various Twitter Blue-subscribed profiles have been identified as using AI-generated profile images, and have been approved for the program despite being non-human entities.\nTwitter user Conspirator0 has shared a range of examples of these AI-generate accounts, which are currently active Twitter Blue subscribers in the app.\nAs reported by"

The AI Image Generation Tool lets marketers, designers, and advertisers create individualised ads using AI to create an unlimited number of customised assets in different styles, formats, and resolutions.\nUser acquisition has become more challenging in the wake of Apples App Tracking Transparency policies, meaning that creating quality advertising is more important than ever before, said AdLiven CEO David Carter. Integrating AI into the AdLiven Playable Platform means its quicker, easier, and more cost-effective for advertisers to create and make changes to their playable ads.\nThe tool uses a neural network built to identify specific variables linked to playable ads..This network can recognise and generate images based on three inputs: existing ad, an image, or a manual text prompt.\nAlongside providing a seamlessly infinite variation of creatives, the tool streamlines the process of ad creation through the power of AI, land the company hopes this will let creators make more effective ads quicker than ever before.\nThe future of advertising?\nSince each of AdLivens playable ads is custom built, the tool can tailor its solution for each one individually, tailoring its solutions by analysing ad engagement and seeing which elements are driving performance. Through this method, the tool can create ads which allow for better targeting of users in different segments, whether thats network, device, or region.\nUser acquisition has become increasingly difficult in recent years, in part due to recent changes in privacy regulations and consumers becoming more aware of how their data is used. As such, ad marketers and creatives need to consider how they can maintain their performance, and this can include thinking outside the box. While AdLivens AI approach may be the first on the market, its also one that will likely become more common in the future as creators adapt to the current advertising climate.\nYesterday,"

However, the ingenuity of humans shone through one more time as somebody asked the chatbot for stock market advice.\nChatGPT responded that the stock market was too hard to predict and that it did not have access to live stock data. However, ETF Managers Group, in partnership with a fintech firm Equbot has been using AI to pick holdings in the $102 million AI-powered Equity ETF (AIEQ) since 2017. The fund has doubled the returns on the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) this year.\nHow does the AI-powered ETF work?\nThe AIEQ has 114 securities in its portfolio and taps into the processing power of the Watson supercomputer built by IBM to decide which securities to hold and which to replace.\nInstead of simply relying on standard market data as available from the likes of Bloomberg or S&P, AIEQ also looks through unstructured data such as earnings calls, keyword data, and tweets, Chris Natividad, Chief Investment Officer at Equbot told ETF.com\nWhile the VTI was up 6.7 percent up to Jan 27 this year, AIEQ was up 13.5 percent in the same period.\nJust the beginning\nThis might sound like good news for a lot of investors who would want to leave the hassle of managing their portfolio to a bot and enjoy the riches it generates. However, the positive news from the bot has come after a long wait of nearly six years.\nMost Popular\nDuring this time, the AIEQ has largely trailed the VTI. Considering a three-year average, the AIEQ provided a 4.8 percent return while the VTI's return was 9.1 percent. Going back further, the AIEQ's return is marginally better at 5.5 percent while the VTI delivered an 8.6 percent return.\nThe difference in the returns assumes significance when one considers that the VTI's portfolio has nearly 4,000 securities as against AIEQ's 114. Considering that the AI uses machine learning to pick its stocks, it is perhaps only now that the bot is getting better at it and the near future will demonstrate what it is really capable of. Or maybe, it will do just as well as the hamster did to trade crypto at its peak.\nEven if you were willing to take the risk, one must warn you that the AI's powerful advice also comes at a financial cost. The AIEQ is an actively managed ETF and charges 0.75 percent for the transactions carried out. On the other hand, the VTI levies a rock-bottom price of 0.03 percent on your transactions. That is something you need to consider as well, before deciding to give all-in to the bot.\nNo need to rush, this is just the beginning of the AI age and there will likely be more options to choose from in the future."

This is the name of an always-on Twitch stream, embedded below, which broadcasts AI-generated episodes of Seinfeld. The creators studiously avoid using the 'S' word at any point but the link is made crystal clear by the title, logo, and everything in the show itself. Seinfeld being \"a show about nothing\" was an in-joke that acquired wide traction. \"The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later,\"\nsaid Jerry Seinfeld in 2012\n(opens in new tab)\n, \"and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that\".\nThis is one of the oddest AI creations I've ever seen. The most striking thing about it, though you'll need to watch for a few minutes to get this sense, is how it sometimes gets the pacing of a given scene so spot-on, and that many of the jokes made by the characters are actually funny. Don't get me wrong, you're not going to think you've stumbled across a long-lost archive of unseen Seinfeld material, but it is abundantly clear that this thing has a sense of what it's trying to create and is some of the way there.\nIt doesn't always work, either, which just adds to the discombobulation of watching. The characters will often glitch when moving: the 'Elaine' avatar just went to sit down and her leg seemed to do a semi-circle around her torso before settling back. Sometimes they'll be talking and then just stop, the scene pausing and left to hang in the air as unknown algorithms whirr away furiously in silence, and Twitch chat hangs in suspense.\nThen there's that human element, Twitch chat itself, elevating the bizarre into the communal. Good jokes are greeted uproariously, certain lines become their own little mini-memes for a few minutes, and things like the microwave's constant beeping are now a beloved cameo. There's almost this sense of cheering the AI on, and a shared pleasure when it gets something right.\nThe creators, Mismatch Media, say that \"Nothing, Forever is a show about nothing, that happens forever. Kinda like popular sitcoms of the past, except that it never stops.\" It runs constantly and generates new content every minute. \"Everything you see, hear, or experience (with the exception of the artwork and laugh track) is always brand new content, generated via machine learning and AI algorithms.\" It uses AI tech including Open AI, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, among others.\nThe big question I have is where the input data is coming from. The episodes that this thing is generating, if we're going to call them that, have unmistakeable echoes of Seinfeld even if they're original creations, while things like the characters, settings, and pacing of the dialogue (when it gets it right) are aligned with the show. Is this thing working from the scripts or the episodes? Because on some level it must be. I've asked Mismatch Media about this and will update with any response but so far, appropriately enough, nothing.\nPC Gamer Newsletter\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the"

    "body": ",\nFeb. 1, 2023\n/PRNewswire/ -- Clausematch, a technology company developing solutions for regulatory compliance, today announced it has released the digital knowledge graph in open source. Regulators and financial services companies now have access to test the graph and see how regulation in a structured digital format works. The AI developments carried out by Clausematch underlying the release of the knowledge graph fundamentally transform the approach to the very understanding of regulation and how it can be delivered.\nContinue Reading\nThe knowledge graph, if adopted by regulators, will transform the way regulation is distributed and consumed.\nClausematch has been involved in a series of projects in this domain with financial services regulators since 2019. Thus, the FSRA of ADGM launched proofs-of-concepts in the digital regulation field where Clausematch was working on knowledge graphs and API-enabled rulebooks digitising ADGM's\ncrypto\nregulation. The joint team reimagined the regulatory framework by taking the content of regulatory requirements, automatically categorising them using advanced AI models, creating tags focused on regulatory concepts, obligations and expectation.\nWith the digital regulatory rulebooks, financial institutions will be able to gain a deeper contextual understanding of the current applicable legislation and apply requirements more effectively and efficiently. The knowledge graph will become a source of digitised rules available for the use of decision automation systems. With the help of AI models, the knowledge graph will extract the understanding of regulations and embed it in a structured, dynamic, machine-executable form. Eventually, this will enable more institutions and firms to foster greater governance practice and transparency in their daily operations being compliant by design.\nSpeaking on the collaboration,\nEvgeny Likhoded, CEO and Founder at Clausematch, said:\n\"Regulators need to become active advocates of a new structured approach to regulatory texts. When regulations are digital, it gives a tremendous advantage and capability to businesses to achieve an entirely new level of compliance and transparency. We have been working on these developments since 2019 and we are proud to be releasing the results in an open domain as this can take the industry forward much quicker. Working with regulators and financial services institutions, we are committed to continue to innovate and take compliance to the next level. The more regulators align with this vision of structured machine-readable regulations, the faster we can propel the industry to improve and significantly reduce the cost of compliance.\"\nIt is well known that AI systems can process large amounts of data. The number of processes is increasing and growing. It is necessary to automate the deep analysis of content produced by both parties: the regulators and the regulated firms. By training AI for rule interpretation tasks we can capture the understanding, the very meaning of regulation out of people's heads and put it into digital form so that it can be copied and reproduced an unlimited number of times.\nDigitizing regulation provides unparalleled advantages to consumers and businesses, helping to meet changing requirements and improve efficiency.\nTo highlight this development and its impact, Clausematch also published a scientific paper on the application of knowledge graph technologies for regulations.\nFind it here:"

    "body": "Published Feb 1st, 2023 8:28AM EST\nImage: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\nUnleashed upon the world late last year, ChatGPT is a viral sensation. The chatbot can offer answers to questions, write computer code, and pass law and business school exams. It has taken the tech world by storm. Google initially downplayed ChatGPTs threat to Google Search, but the company internally declared a code red afterward, shifting tons of resources to its own AI products. One of them might already be in testing at Google, an Apprentice Bard chatbot that appears on the Search home page, offering features similar to ChatGPT.\nNobody would blame people for thinking ChatGPT is the kind of feature that Google would develop for the future of Search. Its precisely what we expect from a company that made massive progress with human speech and artificial intelligence (AI).\nBut Google might not want to release products like ChatGPT until theyre ready to be as reliable as traditional Search. Thats what Google hinted at when first reacting to ChatGPT.\nReports that followed showed Sundar Pichai wants all hands on deck at Google, working on ChatGPT-like products that could be demoed this spring. Even Googles co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are back for this endeavor.\nUnsurprisingly, Google is already testing a ChatGPT-like home page. Its called Apprentice Bard, and it uses Googles LaMDA language technology. Thats according to CNBCs sources.\nIf accurate, this proves Google has had products like ChatGPT in development all along. OpenAI just beat them to market with a ChatGPT product thats not really ready to replace Google Search.\nU.S. Rep. Ted Lieu on January 26 introduced the first-ever congressional legislation written by the AI-powered ChatGPT. Image source: phonlamaiphoto/Adobe\nCNBC says Googles name for its code red reaction to ChatGPT is called Project Atlas. Thats in addition to the Apprentice Bard chatbot that Googlers can already test internally. Furthermore, Google is reportedly testing a new Search desktop design that could support a question-and-answer form for Apprentice Bard.\nHow Googles ChatGPT alternatives for Search work\nAs a result of ChatGPT, the LaMDA team has been asked to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT, said an internal Google memo viewed by CNBC. In the short term, it takes precedence over other projects.\nApprentice Bard looks like ChatGPT but uses the LaMDA tool for dialogue with users. The report notes that Googles chatbot can deliver answers that include recent events. Thats something ChatGPT doesnt have access to yet. Moreover, Googlers have noticed that Apprentice Bards responses have become more advanced in recent weeks:\nIn one example circulated internally, a tester asked Apprentice Bard if there will be another round of layoffs at Google. The company laid off 12,000 employees, 6% of its workforce, earlier this month.\nAccording to my data base access, it is unlikely for Google to conduct another round of layoffs in 2023, the response reads. Layoffs are generally conducted to reduce costs and structure, but the company is doing well financially. In fact, Googles revenue increased by 34% in 2021, and the companys stock price has risen by 70% since January 2022.\nGoogle is also testing an alternate Search page that would support questions and answers:\nOne view showed the home search page offering five different prompts for potential questions placed directly under the main search bar, replacing the current Im feeling lucky bar. It also showed a small chat logo inside the far right end of the search bar.\nWhen the user enters a question, the search results show a grey bubble under the search bar. This will offer more human-like responses than regular search results. The page will also suggest follow-up questions related to the first one. Only then will you see regular search results, like links and headlines.\nFinally, the report says Google has been testing a beta LaMDA chatbot against ChatGPT.\nIts unclear when Google might make its ChatGPT rivals available to the public, even in a beta form. But the CNBC report suggests that while Google might be scared of ChatGPT, its definitely ready to compete. With such AI projects in development, it seems highly unlikely that Google Search will lose its search supremacy to ChatGPT without a fierce fight."

Following the announcement of a new Digital Partnership between the EU and Singapore by President von der Leyen and Prime Minister Lee at the EU-ASEAN summit in December 2022, Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton and Singapore Minister of Industry and Trade S Iswaran signed a Digital Partnership that will strengthen cooperation between the EU and Singapore on digital technology areas. Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis and Minister Iswaran also signed Digital Trade Principles. A key deliverable of the Digital Partnership, the Principles seek to facilitate the free flow of goods and services in the digital economy, while upholding privacy.\nThe EU-Singapore Digital Partnership reflects the dynamic relation the EU has built with an open and outward-oriented economy and a vibrant logistics and financial hub in South-East Asia. Both sides have agreed to work together on critical areas such as semiconductors, trusted data flows and data innovation, digital trust, standards, digital trade facilitation, digital skills for workers, and the digital transformation of businesses and public services. This Partnership is in line with the 2030 Digital Compass, the European way for the Digital Decade and represents another key step in the implementation of the EUs Indo-Pacific Strategy.\nThe Digital Partnership will, for example:\nEnhance research cooperation in cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors;\nPromote cooperation in regulatory approaches such as in the field of AI and Electronic Identification (eID);\nFoster investments in resilient and sustainable digital infrastructures, including data centres and submarine telecommunications cables for connectivity between the EU and Southeast Asia;\nEnsure trusted cross border data flows in compliance with data protection rules and other public policy objectives;\nPromote information exchange and cooperation in the field of cybersecurity;\nBuild alliances in international organisations and standardisation fora;\nFacilitate digital trade, including by working towards joint projects such as paperless trading, electronic invoicing, electronic payments, electronic transactions framework.\nFollowing the signature of the Partnership, an inaugural Digital Partnership Council was held, which set the priority areas of cooperation for the year ahead. It was co-chaired by Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton and Singapore Minister of Industry and Trade S Iswaran. Singapore and the EU agreed on key priorities of implementation for 2023: exploring common approaches in e-identification and in Artificial Intelligence governance as well as working on projects to facilitate digital trade and SMEs digital transformation.\nThe signature of the Digital Trade Principles represents a first tangible outcome of our digital partnership and a key step in the implementation of the EUs Indo-Pacific Strategy. The principles demonstrate that the EU and Singapore share the same commitment to an open, fair and competitive digital economy, without unjustified trade barriers.\nBackground\nThe EU-Singapore Digital Partnership is the third signed with key partners in Asia. The first digital partnership was concluded in May 2022 with Japan during the 28th EU-Japan Summit, and the second with the Republic of Korea in November 2022. The Partnerships establish an annual high-level meeting  the Digital Partnership Council  led by Commissioner Breton on the EU side and the relevant Minister for each of the three partner countries. The Digital Partnership Councils provide the political steer, set the priorities for implementation and take stock of the progress achieved.\nShare this Sting:"

Meanwhile, three female fine artists recently filed a class action lawsuit in the US against several AI companies, charging them with theft of creative ideas. There's no doubt that artificial intelligence is making its way into the art world. While the consequences remain uncertain at this early stage, artists are already concerned about the appropriation of their intellectual property. (Also read: ChatGPT owner launches 'imperfect' tool to detect AI-generated text)Will AI forever change art?Nonetheless, the art market has begun to do business with AI art as algorithm-generated works feature in museum exhibitions. But how will AI change creative expression itself?Ai-Da is the world's first humanoid robot artist to draw and paint with the help of AI and caused a sensation when it created works at the 2022 Venice Art Biennale.Algorithms process the information and let the robot's arm draw portraits of people. Ai-Da's creator, Aiden Miller, developed her with a team of computer scientists, robotics experts and designers. Each of Al-Da's works is unique. But is it creative?Here come the robotsThe Vitra Design Museum near Basel named its current exhibition about the relationship between man and machine, \"Hello, Robot.\"\"What fundamentally interests people in robotics and artificial intelligence is the very old human longing to play God,\" says curator Amelie Klein.Her show features a robot that writes manifestos. \"This robot is dumb as a box of rocks,\" she explained. \"It knows three languages, vocabulary, grammar, syntax, but it doesn't understand what it's writing,\" Klein told DW.While Robots, androids and artificial intelligence have long been a feature of sci-fi films, from \"Metropolis\" to \"Blade Runner\" and \"Matrix,\" can AI progress to feel emotions and realize art?Not any time soon, according to Vitra Design Museum director, Matteo Kries, who insists that \"the machine cannot feel emotions.\"'This song sucks'Nick Cave would agree. The chorus of the AI-generated song a fan sent him in a Nick Cave \"style\" is not quite poetry.\"I am the sinner, I am the saint, I am the darkness, I am the light, I am the hunter, I am the prey, I am the devil, I am the savior.\"Cave posted a response on his website, explaining why he feels the ChatGPT-generated song is \"bullshit\" and a \"grotesque mockery of what it is to be human.\"AI might be able to write a speech, essay, sermon or obituary, but not a \"genuine\" song, Cave says.\"Songs arise out of suffering, they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation.\"\"Algorithms don't feel, data doesn't suffer,\" Cave writes.When machines dabble in artWhen a brand-new Rembrandt appeared on the scene in the Netherlands in 2016, it was an \"in the style of the Dutch master\" AI-created work fed with data from 346 actual Rembrandt paintings.The countless algorithms that calculated the image were created by a team of programmers and scientists from Delft University of Technology, and Microsoft AI experts.Two years later, an AI-generated work of art achieved a respectable sale for the first time. A portrait named Edmond De Belamy, created by an algorithm fed with 15,000 paintings from different eras, was auctioned at Christie's auction house in New York for $433,000 (397,000).The French creative collective Obvious provided an entirely fictional De Belamy family tree, a golden frame  and instead of the artist's signature, the algorithmic formula.What AI programs like Midjourney, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion can do for images, Chat GPT developed by Open AI can do for text content. It conducts conversations, answers questions, and composes texts of various kinds on demand. Students increasingly use the software.Who is the author?Who owns a work generated by a machine that has been fed with millions of  copyrighted  images and texts? Who is the originator of the creation? Is the AI the author, or are the programmers? Perhaps Picasso, Rembrandt or Van Gogh and the artists and writers whose works provided the data for the machine?Vitra Design Museum director Kries does not believe artificial intelligence will eventually replace the emotional aspect of art and creativity.Vinzent Britz, art director, motion designer and lecturer at Berlin's College of Fine Arts, compares the current situation to the transition from classical painting to photography.Before photography became an established art form, \"there was resistance, people said that's not art, that's a photo, that's plagiarism,\" Britz told DW. He expects a similar development in the case of artificial intelligence.Making AI 'fair and ethical'The three artists  Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan and Karla Ortiz  that have filed a class action lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney and the Deviant Art platform seek damages and an \"injunction to prevent future harm.\"Their attorney Matthew Butterick writes on his website that the lawsuit is \"another step toward making AI fair and ethical for everyone.\"It seems there is still a long way to go.This article was originally written in German."

    "body": "How does RPA fit into modern automation solutions?\nBy\n|\nFebruary 1, 2023\nIn the world of automation, AI and robotics are the hottest topics. Nearly any discussion about automation eventually makes its way back to them. Rarely, however, is robotic process automation (RPA) talked about. This blog will do just that, discussing how RPA came about, when and why its used, and how it stacks up against AI.\nBy Jared Worth\nWhat is RPA?\nRPA is a form of automation that got its start in the 90s, originally being used for automated user interface testing\n1\n. Its a rule-based form of automation, relying on a set of specific parameters to carry out tasks. Its fully software-based, so no physical robots or other\nautomation devices\nare necessary for RPA. Even better, extensive coding is rarely, if ever, required to set up an RPA bot.\nSince RPA requires specific rules to be laid out, and cant deviate from them or adapt based on context, it can only be used for concrete tasks that dont require analysis, such as copying and pasting information, moving files, or processing returns for online orders\n2\n. This may give the impression that RPA is a low-value prospect, but it can actually provide cost savings of around 40-70%\n3\n. Human workers are much more likely to make errors that can prove costly over time, whereas RPA avoids these mistakes while performing tasks faster than humans could in the first place. Human workers are then free to work on more creative, high-level tasks not fit for automation.\nHow does RPA differ from AI?\nA somewhat common misconception about RPA is that its the same as AI, or an application of it. However, this is not the case. While similar, the two have key differences that set them apart and dictate which applications each can be used for.\nIts easiest to think of RPA as mimicking human actions, and AI mimicking human intelligence/decision making\n4\n. RPA is strictly rule-based, meaning unlike AI it cant adapt to new situations based on context or learn new behaviors. It can carry out repetitive tasks quickly and accurately, but without specific rules RPA cant function. Since AI focuses on creating a\nrobotic intelligence\nbased on human decision making, it can make logical decisions based on information and context with minimal oversight. With this in mind AI may seem like the clear-cut winner between the two, but both RPA and AI have their place in automation.\nIntegrating RPA with AI\nFinally, its important to see the bigger picture and understand how RPA can be integrated with AI to create fully autonomous systems that fully take advantage of each technology. One possible implementation is an automated mailing system. AI could analyze emails that come in, sorting them based on topic, urgency, and sender. Then, RPA could be used to automatically send out pre-written response templates based on how the AI sorts the emails\n4\n. Processing insurance claims is another possible implementation. RPA can be used to extract data from insurance claims, and AI can analyze the data to detect signs of potential fraud\n5\n.\nAutomated manufacturing solutions could benefit greatly from intelligent automation as well. AI is already used heavily in the industry, especially in\ncondition monitoring\nand\npredictive maintenance\nsystems. Data is constantly recorded and analyzed to determine when a machine will need maintenance. Systems like i.Sense condition monitoring from igus can even utilize RPA to automatically shut down a machine if data values fall out of an acceptable range to prevent severe damage from occurring. If your automation solution makes use of\nrobot control software\n, then RPA can even be used to automate software inputs as well.\nConclusion\nRPA is a simple and effective way to begin your automation journey. Get those boring and repetitive tasks off your plate and focus on something more thought-provoking and creative, and save money doing it.\nIf you have further questions about RPA or other automation solutions, speak to an igus\nlow-cost automation expert"

    "body": "Spains regional elections are still nearly four months away, but Irene Larraz and her team at Newtral are already braced for impact. Each morning, half of Larrazs team at the Madrid-based media company sets a schedule of political speeches and debates, preparing to fact-check politicians statements. The other half, which debunks disinformation, scans the web for viral falsehoods and works to infiltrate groups spreading lies. Once the May elections are out of the way, a national election has to be called before the end of the year, which will likely prompt a rush of online falsehoods. Its going to be quite hard, Larraz says. We are already getting prepared.\n\nThe proliferation of online misinformation and propaganda has meant an uphill battle for fact-checkers worldwide, who have to sift through and verify vast quantities of information during complex or fast-moving situations, such as the[Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/moldova-disinformation-war-ukraine), the[Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/twitter-sudden-death-vaccine-conspiracies), or election campaigns. That task has become even harder with the advent of chatbots using large language models, such as OpenAIs ChatGPT, which can produce natural-sounding text at the click of a button, essentially automating the production of misinformation.\n\nFaced with this asymmetry, fact-checking organizations are having to build their own AI-driven tools to help automate and accelerate their work. Its far from a complete solution, but fact-checkers hope these new tools will at least keep the gap between them and their adversaries from widening too fast, at a moment when social media companies are scaling back their own moderation operations.\n\nThe race between fact-checkers and those they are checking on is an unequal one, says Tim Gordon, cofounder of Best Practice AI, an artificial intelligence strategy and governance advisory firm, and a trustee of a UK fact-checking charity.\n\nFact-checkers are often tiny organizations compared to those producing disinformation, Gordon says. And the scale of what generative AI can produce, and the pace at which it can do so, means that this race is only going to get harder.\n\nNewtral began developing its multilingual AI language model, ClaimHunter, in 2020, funded by the profits from its TV wing, which produces a[show fact-checking politicians](https://www.lasexta.com/programas/el-objetivo/), and documentaries for HBO and Netflix.\n\nUsing Microsofts[BERT language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), ClaimHunters developers used 10,000 statements to train the system to recognize sentences that appear to include declarations of fact, such as data, numbers, or comparisons. We were teaching the machine to play the role of a fact-checker, says Newtrals chief technology officer, Rubn Mguez.\n\nSimply identifying claims made by political figures and social media accounts that need to be checked is an arduous task. ClaimHunter automatically detects political claims made on Twitter, while another application transcribes video and audio coverage of politicians into text. Both identify and highlight statements that contain a claim relevant to public life that can be proved or disprovedas in, statements that arent ambiguous, questions, or opinionsand flag them to Newtrals fact-checkers for review.\n\nThe system isnt perfect, and occasionally flags opinions as facts, but its mistakes help users to continually retrain the algorithm. It has cut the time it takes to identify statements worth checking by 70 to 80 percent, Mguez says.\n\nHaving this technology is a huge step to listen to more politicians, find more facts to check, [and] debunk more disinformation, Larraz says. Before, we could only do a small part of the work we do today.\n\nNewtral is also working with the London School of Economics and the broadcaster ABC Australia to develop a[claim matching tool](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2022/09/22/how-were-trying-to-identify-false-claims-using-ai/) that identifies repeated false statements made by politicians, saving fact-checkers time by recycling existing clarifications and articles debunking the claims.\n\nThe quest to automate fact-checking isnt new. The founder of the American fact-checking organization Politifact, Bill Adair, first experimented with an instant verification tool called[Squash](https://reporterslab.org/tag/squash/) at Duke University Reporters Lab in 2013. Squash live-matched politicians speeches with previous fact-checks available online, but its utility was limited. It didnt have access to a big enough library of fact-checked pieces to cross-reference claims against, and its transcriptions were full of errors that humans needed to double-check.\n\nSquash was an excellent first step that showed us the promise and challenges of live fact-checking, Adair tells WIRED. Now, we need to marry what weve done with new advances in AI and develop the next generation.\n\nBut a decade on, fact-checking is still a long way from being fully automated. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can produce text that looks like it was written by a person, it cannot detect nuance in language, and has a tendency to[make things up](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/chatgpt-fluent-bs) and[amplify biases and stereotypes](https://www.wired.com/story/efforts-make-text-ai-less-racist-terrible/).\n\n[LLMs] dont know what facts are, says Andy Dudfield, head of AI at Full Fact, a UK fact-checking charity, which has also used a BERT model to automate parts of its fact-checking workflow. [Fact-checking] is a very subtle world of context and caveats.\n\nWhile the AI may appear to be formulating arguments and conclusions, it isnt actually making complex judgements, meaning it cant, for example, give a rating of how truthful a statement is.\n\nLLMs also lack knowledge of day-to-day events, meaning they arent particularly useful when fact-checking breaking news. They know the whole of Wikipedia but they dont know what happened last week, says Newtrals Mguez. Thats a big issue.\n\nAs a result, fully automated fact-checking is very far off, says Michael Schlichtkrull, a postdoctoral research associate in automated fact verification at the University of Cambridge. A combined system where you have a human and a machine working together, like a cyborg fact-checker, [is] something thats already happening and well see more of in the next few years.\n\nBut Mguez sees further breakthroughs within reach. When we started to work on this problem in Newtral, the question was if we can automate fact-checking. Now the question for us is when we can fully automate fact-checking. Our main interest now is how we can accelerate this because the fake technologies are moving forward quicker than technologies to detect disinformation.\n\nFact-checkers and researchers say there is a real urgency to the search for tools to scale up and speed up their work, as generative AI increa"

The\njoint work\nFoundation models\nare types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another. These models have rapidly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) technology over the last five years, and IBM is pioneering applications of foundation models beyond language.\nEarth observations that allow scientists to study and monitor our planet are being gathered at unprecedented rates and volume. New and innovative approaches are required to extract knowledge from these vast data resources. The goal of this work is to provide an easier way for researchers to analyze and draw insights from these large datasets. IBMs foundation model technology has the potential to speed up the discovery and analysis of these data in order to quickly advance the scientific understanding of Earth and response to climate-related issues.\nIBM and NASA plan to develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations. One project will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASAs\nHarmonized Landsat Sentinel-2\n(HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites. By analyzing petabytes of satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields, and wildlife habitats, this foundation model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planets environmental systems.\nAnother output from this collaboration is expected to be an easily searchable corpus of Earth science literature. IBM has developed an NLP model trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organize the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge. Containing one of the largest AI workloads trained on\nsoftware to date, the fully trained model uses PrimeQA, IBMs open-source multilingual question-answering system. Beyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science could be infused into NASAs scientific data management and stewardship processes.\nThe beauty of foundation models is they can potentially be used for many downstream applications, said\nRahul Ramachandran\n, senior research scientist at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in\nHuntsville, Alabama\n. Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams, he added. You need teams across different organizations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets.\nFoundation models have proven successful in natural language processing, and its time to expand that to new domains and modalities important for business and society, said\nRaghu Ganti\n, principal researcher at IBM. Applying foundation models to geospatial, event-sequence, time-series, and other non-language factors within Earth science data could make enormously valuable insights and information suddenly available to a much wider group of researchers, businesses, and citizens. Ultimately, it could facilitate a larger number of people working on some of our most pressing climate issues.\nOther potential IBM-NASA joint projects in this agreement include constructing a foundation model for weather and climate prediction using MERRA-2, a dataset of atmospheric observations. This collaboration is part of NASAs Open-Source Science Initiative, a commitment to building an inclusive, transparent, and collaborative open science community over the next decade.\nTAGS"

    "body": "OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company behind viral text-generator ChatGPT, has released a new AI tool intended to help manage the mess wrought by its previous creation. Unfortunately, its not very good.\n\n\nThe company announced a free web-based AI-detection widget on Tuesday. The application is intended to classify text samples based on how likely they are to have been generated by artificial intelligence vs. written by an actual person. Given a sample of text, it spits out one of five possible assessments: Very unlikely to have been AI-generated, unlikely, unclear, possible, or likely.\n\n However, in OpenAIs own tests, the tool only correctly identified generated text as likely AI-written about a quarter of the time. Moreover, about one in ten times, the classifier falsely lists human-made words as computer-generated, the company noted in a blog post. \n\nAccording to OpenAI, even these meh results are an improvement on the companys previous stab at AI-text detection. And the tech startup acknowledged that, thanks to its own invention, we need improvement. \n\nOpenAI admits that ChatGPT has thrown a complicating wrench into classrooms, newsrooms, and beyondwhere the tool and others like it have stoked fears of rampant cheating, misleading info, and copyright violations. In response, the company now says it wants to help. We recognize that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognizing the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom, the company said in its Tuesday blog. While this resource is focused on educators, we expect our classifier and associated classifier tools to have an impact on journalists, mis/dis-information researchers, and other groups.\n\nBut in its current form, this new detection tool probably still isnt accurate enough to meaningfully address growing concern over AI-enabled plagiarism, academic dishonesty, and the propagation of misinformation. Our classifier is not fully reliable, the company wrote. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool.\n\n\nIn other words, if you suspect a news article or classroom assignment is AI-generated, whatever OpenAIs classifier tells you may or may not be true.\n\nIn Gizmodos own tests, the classifier didnt yield particularly impressive results. With multiple tests of AI-generated text, the detector gave me lukewarm results. Possibly AI-generated, it said about a fake news article I generated in ChatGPT moments earlier.\n\nI got the same result using a chunk of AI-produced text from ChatGPTs stab at writing an article about itself. \n\nIn response to a clip from a CNET article produced via assist[ance] by an AI engine, OpenAIs detector told me it was unlikely to have been AI-generated. \n\nHowever, to the tools credit, in 10 or so tries, I didnt get a false positive on any text from recently published Gizmodo articles. The only response the classifier yielded on the Gizmodo posts I tested was very unlikely AI-generated. OpenAI noted that it purposely adjusted the confidence threshold to keep the false positive rate very low, in the web version of its new AI-tool. So potentially, that adjustment is working out well. Though the 9% false-positive rate that OpenAI self-reported is still pretty high. \n\nSome additional limitations of the tool include that it only passably works with English and not other languages, that AI-written text can easily be edited to bypass the classifier, and that only lengthy text samples yield sort of accurate results with any reliability, according to the company. \n\nTheoretically though, the AI-detector should get better with more use, because it itself is AI-based. The classifier is a language model trained on pairs of AI-generated/human-written text samples on the same topic. And, by opening up this stage of the classifier to the public, OpenAI is hoping to get feedback on it and share improved methods in the future.\n\nGizmodo contacted OpenAI with questions about its new tool, and was directed back to the blog post.\n\nThe company isnt the first to try its hand at AI detection. A college student, Edward Tian, recently released his own program. And if you write about AI publicly like this Gizmodo author, then youll know that press releases touting the hottest new AI-detection software abound. But across the board, existing tools dont seem to hold up so well against the forward march of AI-production capabilities. Like humans, automated AI detectors keep getting things wrong, as in one recent pre-print study where an automatic detector failed to clock AI-generated text more than one-third of the time.\n\nUltimately, its hard to imagine how AI could learn to outsmart itself, especially as the results of AI-generation become increasingly convincing. In trying to develop reliable AI-detection, OpenAI has entered a race with itself. The better an AI text-generator, the harder it should be to suss out the resulting sentences AI origins. And since OpenAI is presumably trying to improve upon ChatGPT at the same time as its trying to improve its classification detection tool, it seems like an impossible race to win."

This is our answer to celebrities like Kanye West.'\nNow\nAshkelon\n's Palace of Culture is also trying to make the Holocaust accessible  its exhibition uses artificial intelligence generated fake images that are supposed to reflect survivors' stories.\nThe result is puzzling. The creators say the exhibit features Jews during the Holocaust, but the people in the photos dont look like Jews from that period: they're dressed well, the womens and girls hair is luxuriant, and their skin is flushed and clean. The children are eating potatoes.\nOpen gallery view\nAI generated images from the exhibition.\nCredit: Sivan Metodi\nAs far as I know, Jews in concentration camps had a hard enough time finding a potato peel. Apart from the lack of realism, the images lack emotion, like a poster sold at a shopping mall.\nOn Facebook,\n'New Memory Genre': Holocaust Victim's Instagram Draws Fire for Dumbing Down History\nIn a statement released by the city, a teenager who visited the exhibit says: The use of technology helps make history accessible in a way thats more relevant to our generation. Gal Gadot was Hollywoods first Israeli superhero, but the survivors of the Holocaust were the first superheroes of Jewish history. This is our answer to celebrities like Kanye West. Gal is invited to take part in the project.\nThats the comparison  Gal Gadot and Holocaust survivors.\nOpen gallery view\nAI generated images from the exhibition.\nCredit: Sivan Metodi\nAI can play innovative roles in medicine, defense and elsewhere, but its entry into the creative world is problematic and even dangerous. More and more works are using AI, and all of them lack the human touch and emotion.\nThat's because AI doesnt know how to express empathy\n. It lacks feeling. So AI animation of Holocaust scenes creates an alternative history at the cost of ignoring the real testimonies and artifacts. Contrary to the view of Ashkelon's mayor, such testimonies illustrate the Shoah in the most powerful way possible.\nOver the decades, the stories and testimonies of Holocaust survivors have been adapted for cinema, television and theater. These efforts were done by people. You can say they're dated, hard to watch and unsuitable for todays young people, but they're better at reaching that cohort than AI's efforts thus far.\nIn 2018, an exhibit at the Israeli Cartoon Museum in Holon told the story of childhood during the Holocaust via the medium of a comic book. For example, it showed 22 editions of the comic newspaper Zndluand by 15-year-old Ivan Polak while he was in Theresienstadt. It also showed the avant-garde Maus by Art Spiegelman, whose comics on the Shoah first came out in 1980, and Anne Franks Diary: The Graphic Adaptation by Ari Folman and David Polonski.\nThis exhibit at Holon, a Tel Aviv suburb, presented the Holocaust very powerfully in a modern, out-of-the-ordinary and even sarcastic way. But it didnt distort reality in an emotionless way."

Students can use that same technology to complete homework for them.\nStudents can use all kinds of programs to help them solve math problems and even write essays keeping them from learning how to do it themselves. As AI becomes more commonplace, teachers have to find ways to ensure students arent using it to do their homework for them.\nThere are people working on programs to try to determine whether something has been written by a program, said Lloyd Smith, Computer Science Professor at Missouri State University. So its kind of an AI. Its kind of an arms race. Im sure that AI will get better at writing articles and the tools to catch them. Well get better at catching them.\nThis is different than plagiarism. A student plagiarizes when they take another persons work and claim it as their own. There are programs teachers use to detect plagiarism, but since AI writes new material, its less likely to be detected. While these programs can produce what teachers say is good material, it is not great.\nI had it write a post on the kind of car my son has, and he told me it made a couple of mistakes that werent quite right and what it said, said Smith.

The world has already warmed 1.1 or 1.2 degrees since pre-industrial times, or the mid-19th century, scientists say.\nTwo climate scientists using machine learning calculated that Earth will surpass the 1.5-degree (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) mark between 2033 and 2035. Their results fit with other, more conventional methods of predicting when Earth will break the mark, though with a bit more precision.\nThere will come a time when we call the 1.5C target for maximum warming dead, beyond the shadow of a doubt, Brown University Environment Institute director Kim Cobb, who wasnt part of the study, said in an email interview. And this paper may be the beginning of the end of the 1.5C target.\nStanford Universitys Noah Diffenbaugh, a study co-author, said the world is on the brink of the 1.5-degree mark in any realistic emissions reduction scenario. Avoiding a 2-degree rise, he said, may depend on nations meeting zero-emissions goals by the middle of this century.\nThe artificial intelligence-based study found it unlikely that temperature increase could be held below 2 degrees Celsius, even with tough emissions cuts. And thats where the AI really differs with scientists who had been forecasting using computer models that are based on past observations, Diffenbaugh said.\nIn a high-pollution scenario, the AI calculated, the world would hit the 2-degree mark around 2050. Lower pollution could stave that off until 2054, the machine learning calculated.\nIn contrast, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change figured in its 2021 report that the same lower-pollution scenario would see the world pushing past 2 degrees sometime in the 2090s.\nCornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasnt part of the Diffenbaugh study but was part of the IPCC, said the study makes sense, fits with what scientists know, but seems a bit more pessimistic.\nTheres a lot of power in using AI, and in the future, that may be shown to produce better projections, but more evidence is needed before concluding that, Mahowald said.\nNormally, climate scientists use a bunch of computer model simulations, some running hot and some cold, and then try to figure out which ones are doing the best job. Thats often based on how they performed in the past or in simulations of the past, Diffenbaugh said. What the AI does is more keyed to the climate system now, he said.\nWere using this very powerful tool that is able to take information and integrate it in a way that no human mind is able to do, for better or for worse, Diffenbaugh said.\nEach year, government climate negotiators at a United Nations summit proclaim that they have managed to keep 1.5 alive. But with the latest study, theres a divide among scientists on how true that really is. Diffenbaugh said theres been so much warming already that it really doesnt matter how pollution is cut in the next several years. The world will hit 1.5, the AI figures.\nZeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth, who was not part of the study, agreed, saying its time to stop pretending that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is possible. Some scenarios do see temperatures warming past the mark but then coming back down, something called overshoot.\nOther scientists not involved with the study, such as University of Pennsylvanias Michael Mann and Climate Analytics Bill Hare and Carl-Friedrich Schleussner maintain 1.5 is still alive. They say one rapid decarbonization scenario that Diffenbaugh didnt examine shows the world can mostly keep under the threshold.\nIf the world can cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030 then warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees with a tiny overshoot and then reductions to get under the mark, Hare said.\nBelieving that the world can no longer keep warming below 1.5 is a self-fulfilling prophecy, Mann said by email. In the end its easy to overinterpret the significance of a precise threshold like 1.5C warming. The challenge is to limit warming as much as possible.\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated Press (AP)"

    "body": ",\nFeb. 1, 2023\n/PRNewswire/  IBM (NYSE: IBM) and NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center today announce a collaboration to use IBMs artificial intelligence (AI) technology to discover new insights in NASAs massive trove of Earth and geospatial science data. The joint work will apply AI foundation model technology to NASAs Earth-observing satellite data for the first time.\nFoundation models\nare types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another. These models have rapidly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) technology over the last five years, and IBM is pioneering applications of foundation models beyond language.\nEarth observations that allow scientists to study and monitor our planet are being gathered at unprecedented rates and volume. New and innovative approaches are required to extract knowledge from these vast data resources. The goal of this work is to provide an easier way for researchers to analyze and draw insights from these large datasets. IBMs foundation model technology has the potential to speed up the discovery and analysis of these data in order to quickly advance the scientific understanding of Earth and response to climate-related issues.\nIBM and NASA plan to develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations. One project will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASAs\nHarmonized Landsat Sentinel-2\n(HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites. By analyzing petabytes of satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields, and wildlife habitats, this foundation model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planets environmental systems.\nAnother output from this collaboration is expected to be an easily searchable corpus of Earth science literature. IBM has developed an NLP model trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organize the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge. Containing one of the largest AI workloads trained on\nsoftware to date, the fully trained model uses PrimeQA, IBMs open-source multilingual question-answering system. Beyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science could be infused into NASAs scientific data management and stewardship processes.\nThe beauty of foundation models is they can potentially be used for many downstream applications, said\nRahul Ramachandran\n, senior research scientist at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in\nHuntsville, Alabama\n. Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams, he added. You need teams across different organizations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets.\nFoundation models have proven successful in natural language processing, and its time to expand that to new domains and modalities important for business and society, said\nRaghu Ganti\n, principal researcher at IBM. Applying foundation models to geospatial, event-sequence, time-series, and other non-language factors within Earth science data could make enormously valuable insights and information suddenly available to a much wider group of researchers, businesses, and citizens. Ultimately, it could facilitate a larger number of people working on some of our most pressing climate issues.\nOther potential IBM-NASA joint projects in this agreement include constructing a foundation model for weather and climate prediction using MERRA-2, a dataset of atmospheric observations. This collaboration is part of NASAs Open-Source Science Initiative, a commitment to building an inclusive, transparent, and collaborative open science community over the next decade.\nFor more information about this collaboration, visit the IBM Research Blog.\nStatements regarding IBMs future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives only.\nPress contact"

To date, NASA has largely relied on the development of its own set of bespoke AI models to serve specific use cases. The promise of the foundation model approach is a large language model (LLM) that has been trained on lots of data that can serve as a more general purpose system that can be customized as needed.\nAmong the initial goals of the partnership is to train a foundation model on NASAs Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, which has petabytes of data collected from space about land use changes on Earth.\nBeyond just helping to improve the state of climate analysis on Earth, IBM is hopeful that the new foundation model that it develops jointly with NASA will have broader applicability and a positive impact for enterprise use cases of AI as well.\nEvent\nIntelligent Security Summit On-Demand\nLearn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch on-demand sessions today.\nWatch Here\nWhat were doing with NASA is going to help us push innovation all the way from infrastructure and hardware up through distributed systems platforms, middleware and the applications themselves, Priya Nagpurkar, VP, hybrid cloud platform and developer productivity at IBM Research, said during a press briefing announcing the partnership. And it will include driving advances in AI architectures, and even data management techniques.\nHouston, we have a (big data) problem\nTo put it mildly, NASA has a lot of data.\nRahul Ramachandran, senior research scientist at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, explained during the press briefing that NASA actually has the largest collection of Earth observation data. That data has been collected to support NASAs science mission to understand planet Earth as a complex system. The data comes from various instruments, and currently includes an archive with 70 petabytes of data. The archive is projected to grow within a few years to 250 petabytes.\nClearly, given the scale of the data that we have, we have a big data problem, Ramachandran said. Our goal is to make our data discoverable, accessible and usable for broad scientific use in applications worldwide.\nRamachandran added that NASA is always looking for new approaches and technologies that will help streamline the research process, as well as lower the barrier to entry for end users to utilize the complex science data held by the space agency. Thats where the development of foundation models comes into play to make it easier to benefit from the data that NASA has collected.\nThe potential for the foundation model that NASA is building with IBM could literally be life changing for humanity.\nFor example, Ramachandran said that building a foundation model that has satellite image data could make it easier for someone in a disaster area to identify the extent of flooding, where the model automatically maps where the flooding is occurring. Another example could be identifying damage in a hurricane zone.\nPyTorch and open-source AI will also benefit\nOn the technology side, IBM will be making extensive use of a series of technologies, including Red Hat OpenShift, for running the AI-training workloads and open-source machine learning frameworks, notably PyTorch.\nThe open-source PyTorch machine learning framework was started at Facebook (now known as Meta) and spun off as its own PyTorch Foundation in September 2022. IBM Research has been an active contributor to PyTorch, integrating capabilities into the PyTorch 1.13 release framework to help run large workloads on commodity hardware.\nRaghu Ganti, principal researcher at IBM Research, said PyTorch is a core element of IBMs AI strategy.\nWe solely rely on PyTorch for training all our foundation models, Ganti said.\nGanti added that IBM will continue to contribute back to the PyTorch community as it continues to innovate on the technology to build increasingly powerful foundation models. In Gantis view, the joint effort with NASA to build foundation models will have multiple applications and broad impact.\nI think it will augment and accelerate the scientific process in terms of building and solving specific science problems, he said. Instead of people having to build their own individual machine learning pipeline, starting from collecting the large volumes of training data.\nVentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact."
