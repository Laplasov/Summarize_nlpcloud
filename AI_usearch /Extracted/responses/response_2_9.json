{"summary_text":"Nothing, Forever is an always-on Twitch stream that broadcasts AI-generated episodes of Seinfeld. The most striking thing about it is how it sometimes gets the pacing of a given scene so spot-on, and that many of the jokes made by the characters are actually funny. There's almost this sense of cheering the AI on, and a shared pleasure when it gets something right."}
