{"summary_text":"OpenAI has launched a classifier that can distinguish between AI-written and human-written text. The company makes it very clear that its classifier is not fully reliable. Texts with less than 1,000 words are prone to be labelled incorrectly. It performs significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code."}
