{"summary_text":"Scientists at University of California (UC) San Diego School of Medicine, US, have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategy for discovering high-affinity antibody drugs. Researchers used the approach to identify a new antibody that binds a major cancer target 17-fold tighter than any existing antibody drug. The pipeline could accelerate the discovery of novel drugs against cancer and other diseases."}
