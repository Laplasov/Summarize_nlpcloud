{"summary_text":"Nothing, Forever is an AI-generated show about nothing. The show was created by Skyler Hartle and Brian Habersberger. Hartle said the show was supposed to mirror Seinfeld and the point-and-click games of the early 1990s. The artwork and laugh track are pre-generated, but everything else is generated using machine learning models."}
