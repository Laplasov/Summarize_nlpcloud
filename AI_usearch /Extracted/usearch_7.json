    "body": "Gita GPT is going viral on the internet and with good reason. Inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, this application searches the answers in Krishnas updesh. The app, created using the AI models available is built on a clean interface and allows you to ask whatever questions comes to your mind. The app then searches the Bhagavad Gita and for relevant verses.  This application is one of the many now surfacing after the Chat GPT AI tool became available. Does it help? Is it accurate? Check for yourself. A few questions were posed to the application and the answers that were populated are also given below.  Should I leave my jobs?Arjuna, life is transient, and the only thing that is permanent is the soul. To find true joy and contentment, develop a deep connection with your inner self and do what brings peace to your heart. Seek knowledge and guidance from wise ones, and make decisions that align with your highest good. What is money?\"O Arjuna, money is a temporal materialistic pleasure, whereas the real joy lies in the eternal satisfaction of the soul. Focusing on the impermanent will never bring contentment, thus having faith in the divine will bring peace and prosperity.\" But this is not the only app. Another website called krishn.ai also offers a similar platform for you to ask the questions that are bothering you. The same questions were asked to the other website also and the responses are provided below.  Should I leave my job?My beloved Arjun, although financial stability is an important aspect of life, your true wisdom lies in understanding what really brings joy and contentment. Money may seem like a necessary evil, however, it should never be your primary source of joy or satisfaction. If your job is making you unhappy and it is not in line with your highest values, then the greatest victory is in finding the courage to let go. Seek comfort and meaning in the understanding that there is a higher purpose for all of your experiences. You will gain strength and power in making choices that reflect your authentic self. Remember, true liberation lies in your faith in yourself and the divine. What is money?My beloved Arjun, money is nothing but a symbol of material and worldly wealth. It can never provide the same kind of joy and satisfaction that comes from things like knowledge, spiritual progress, and inner peace. True strength lies in your non-material and non-physical assets such as your emotional stability, humility, and faith in yourself. Make use of your wealth and resources in a manner where you can bring happiness and contentment in the lives of those who are less privileged than you. By ensuring that your actions reflect your deepest values and desires, you can have real and lasting victories. Clearly, both the applications are designed around the Bhagavad Gita. So if you are looking for meaning in your life, these quick applications can help you get them.  How to get answers from Gita GPT? Krishn.ai?Its simple and easy. Go to website gita.kishans.in for Gita GPT or to krishn.aiOn the screen, enter the question that is bothering you and press submitThe relevant verse from the Bhagavad Gita would be generated for you.While we hope this helps, the true path of spiritual wisdom and calm comes from true surrender. As Krishna sayssarva-dharmn parityajya mm eka haraa vrajaaha tv sarva-ppebhyo mokhayihymi m hucha Or, surrender unto me and I shall liberate you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear. While finding answers to questions in part is helpful, it is with complete knowledge that you would be able to find meaning and spiritual guidance."

In comparison, TikTok took nine months to reach 100 million monthly users, and Instagram about 2.5 years, according to UBS researcher Lloyd Walmsley.\nFurther Reading\nFearing ChatGPT, Google enlists founders Brin and Page in AI fight\nIn 20 years following the Internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,\" Reuters quotes Walmsley as writing in the UBS note.\nReuters says the UBS data comes from analytics firm Similar Web, which states that around 13 million unique visitors used ChatGPT every day in January, doubling the number of users in December.\nChatGPT is a conversational large language model (LLM) that can discuss almost any topic at an almost human level. It reads context and answers questions easily, though sometimes not accurately (improving its accuracy is a work in progress). After launching as a free public beta on November 30, the GPT-3 powered AI bot has inspired awe, wonder, and fear in education, computer security, and finance. It's shaken up the tech industry, prompting a $10 billion investment from Microsoft and causing Google to see its life flash before its eyes.\nAdvertisement\nAlso on Wednesday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Plus, a $20 per month subscription service that will offer users faster response times, preferential access to ChatGPT during peak times, and priority access to new features. It's an attempt to keep up with the intense demand for ChatGPT that has often seen the site deny users due to overwhelming activity.\nOver the past few decades, researchers have noticed that technology adoption rates are quickening, with inventions such as the telephone, television, and the Internet taking shorter periods of time to reach massive numbers of users. Will generative AI tools be next on that list? With the kind of trajectory shown by ChatGPT, it's entirely possible."

The failures can be extremely unpredictable,\" Huang wrote in Ars Technica, the tech news website.\nJust like Google\nChatGPT is powered by an AI language model that is nearly three years old -- OpenAI's GPT-3 -- and the chatbot only uses a part of its capability.\nThe true revolution is the humanlike chat, said Jason Davis, research professor at Syracuse University.\n\"It's familiar, it's conversational and guess what? It's kind of like putting in a Google search request,\" he said.\nChatGPT's rockstar-like success even shocked its creators at OpenAI, which received billions in new financing from Microsoft in January.\n\"Given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview to StrictlyVC, a newsletter.\n\"We put GPT-3 out almost three years ago... so the incremental update from that to ChatGPT, I felt like should have been predictable and I want to do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that,\" he said.\nThe risk, Altman added, was startling the public and policymakers and on Tuesday his company unveiled a tool for detecting text generated by AI amid concerns from teachers that students may rely on artificial intelligence to do their homework.\nWhat now?\nFrom lawyers to speechwriters, from coders to journalists, everyone is waiting breathlessly to feel disruption caused by ChatGPT. OpenAI just launched a paid version of the chatbot - $20 per month for an improved and faster service.\nFor now, officially, the first significant application of OpenAI's tech will be for Microsoft software products.\nThough details are scarce, most assume that ChatGPT-like capabilities will turn up on the Bing search engine and in the Office suite.\n\"Think about Microsoft Word. I don't have to write an essay or an article, I just have to tell Microsoft Word what I wanted to write with a prompt,\" said Davis.\nHe believes influencers on TikTok and Twitter will be the earliest adopters of this so-called generative AI since going viral requires huge amounts of content and ChatGPT can take care of that in no time.\nThis of course raises the specter of disinformation and spamming carried out at an industrial scale.\nFor now, Davis said the reach of ChatGPT is very limited by computing power, but once this is ramped up, the opportunities and potential dangers will grow exponentially.\nAnd much like the ever imminent arrival of self-driving cars that never quite happens, experts disagree on whether that is a question of months or years.\nRidicule\nLeCun said Meta and Google have refrained from releasing AI as potent as ChatGPT out of fear of ridicule and backlash.\nPromoted"

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh said the university is also looking to introduce AI and data driven courses to its curriculum soon.\nThe Competence Enhancement Scheme, envisioned as part of the New Education Policy, is likely to be launched by Delhi University either this March or during the coming academic year. The scheme will enable students from other universities or even employed professionals to pursue various courses offered by the varsity and earn certificates.\n&#8220The Competence Enhancement Scheme policy is already in place. We are yet to decide whether to implement it, this March or during the coming academic year. This scheme is not particularly for young individuals but for persons already working,&#8221 said Singh.\nStating that the scheme would be beneficial to all, he said, &#8220If someone who is already working wants to take up a course, say, in management, from FMS, they can come to the university, attend classes, give exams, attend practicals and get a certificate.&#8221\nThe scheme would enable students to attend classes they want to learn from, Singh added. &#8220A student studying in university A, can come and attend classes by a professor in university B. A home-maker can come and take classes too. This would enhance the competence of people.&#8221\nThe cut-off would depend on the number of candidates who apply for admission. &#8220For admission into an undergraduate course, marks of Class 12 will be taken and for a post-graduation course, marks of the undergraduate degree would be taken for assessment of admission,&#8221 said Singh.\nA proposal for the implementation of CES was approved by DU's statutory bodies last year. Students can sign up for one or two courses every semester without enrolling in the whole programme.\nAI, Data driven courses to begin\nDelhi University is set to launch a department of technology, the Vice Chancellor said, noting that data sciences and technology are the drivers of the future.\n&#8220Our proposal (to start a department of technology) is with the Government of India. Here, we will start specialisation courses in Artificial Intelligence, data analytics and other engineering courses, as well,&#8221 said Singh.\nThis comes as part of the university's curriculum revamp with newer courses being introduced under the New Education Policy.\nThe university may even add medical courses to its curriculum, said Singh. &#8220We are also planning to begin some medical courses, including MBBS. While we have not sent a proposal yet, we have begun to plan for it. It is still in the pipeline,&#8221 he added.\nThe Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, a postgraduate institute, is the only medical school currently under the purview of Delhi University. Admissions are through the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Delhi.\nWhile many provisions of the New Education Policy have been implemented, including all DU admissions for the 2022-23 batch taking place as per NEP guidelines, other things will take some time, said Singh, adding, &#8220We are working towards making education more inclusive and interactive.&#8221"

The approach holds open the prospect of uncovering ways to arrest the development of cancer by predicting the response of cancerous cells to perturbations including drug treatment.\nThere are a heart-breaking number of aggressive cancers out there with little to no information on where they come from, let alone how to categorize their behavior. This is where machine learning can Dr Sotiris Moschoyiannis, corresponding author of the study from the University of Surreyprovide real hope for us all.\nWhat we have demonstrated is the ability of the reinforcement learning-driven approach to address real large-scale Boolean networks from the study of metastatic melanoma.

    "body": "AFP via Getty Images\nKey takeaways\nChatGPT was released just last year and is already transforming multiple industries. Its release has led to Googles management team declaring a code red situation\nThe chatbot was introduced by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based startup that has received another $10 billion in funding from Microsoft as the major tech giants get competitive in the field of AI\nWhile ChatGPT is popular with some, others are concerned about the impact this tool will have on education and other industries. We explore what could be next for this disruptive technology\nYouve likely heard about ChatGPT, a revolutionary new tool that has made headlines since it was released late last year. The AI-powered chatbot generates responses based on a prompt of user inputs. Users have utilized ChatGPT for everything from help with homework to writing poems. Some see ChatGPT as a direct threat to Googles $149 billion search engine business, an area Google has been the leading player in for years. Microsoft recently confirmed an extension of its partnership with OpenAI, which comes with a $10 billion investment.\nLets look at what ChatGPT is and how this new AI-based tool is transforming multiple industries.\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nChatGPT is the chatbot\nreleased late last year by OpenAI, a company that Elon Musk and Sam Altman helped initially co-found. The bot uses OpenAIs GPT-3.5 language technology, an upgrade of the GPT-3 model released in 2020. ChatGPT had over a million users within its first week. The chatbot uses machine learning to generate human-sounding responses to text prompts. The bot was trained with a plethora of data, from books and articles to conversations. The chatbot can understand a variety of topics and contexts.\nTo get a complete answer, we asked ChatGPT, What is ChatGPT?\nHere was the response from the chatbot:\nMORE FOR YOU\nWednesday, February 1. Russias War On Ukraine: Daily News And Information From Ukraine\nChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that has been trained on a diverse range of internet text to generate human-like responses to a given prompt. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) architecture and can be fine-tuned for various language tasks such as question answering, language translation, and text summarization.\nWhat can I do with ChatGPT?\nAs you might have seen through social media or the news, people have used the chatbot for fun and functional purposes. People have written poems with it, created opening messages for dating apps, and answered silly questions.\nBut others have thought of more useful applications. Some of these include:\nAnswering questions as a replacement for a Google search\nGenerating headlines\nWriting the abstract for a scientific article\nWriting product descriptions, blog posts, and other types of content\nAssisting with homework\nThe chatbot can create unique content for a blog or your social media.\nIn a shocking turn of events, the chatbot passed the Wharton MBA exam. Professor Christian Terwiesch, who organized the test, mentioned how the tool did an \"amazing job at basic operations management and process analysis questions, including those that are based on case studies.\nWhats next for ChatGPT?\nWith everything moving so quickly since the product hit the market, many experts are wondering what will happen next.\nAnother iPhone situation\nSome experts have compared ChatGPTs emergence to that of the first iPhone back in 2007 since the tool is bringing the power of AI into the hands of non-technical users. With over 84% of Americans now owning a smartphone, some believe this AI-based tool will become a household staple for many folks.\nLegal and ethical concerns\nOther major tech companies have avoided introducing a similar product due to legal and ethical concerns. There are worries that the tool could harm some brands' reputations. Can a company take credit for writing generated from a chatbot? How should we share the work that AI generates? One of the worlds largest academic publishers, Springer Nature, recently declared that ChatGPT could not be credited as an author for papers but that theyll allow scientists to use AI to help with writing or generating ideas for research.\nThe paid version is coming\nWhile ChatGPT is currently a free service since the product is in the research stage, OpenAI has already started surveying users on pricing preferences for future chatbot versions.\nSome users have announced they gained access to a pro tier of the chatbot for $42 a month. This professional version would give users priority access even when demand surges, giving you quicker response times for your prompts.\nOpposition to ChatGPT\nEvery new revolutionary tool can be met with pushback. The academic world has had mixed reactions to the software, with some feeling it can be an excellent teaching aid and others worrying students will use the program to plagiarize their work. In response, a student released GPTZero, a tool that can determine whether a piece of writing was generated by ChatGPT. This counter-tool saw over 30,000 users within its first week.\nHow is AI transforming industries?\nEnjoying the detailed responses and helpful content from ChatGPT may seem relatively harmless, but its worth thinking about how AI is causing many industries to evolve. For a great example, look at our Q.ai, which uses AI's power to simplify investing.\nHere are some of the industries impacted by this new chatbot.\nSearch engines\nGoogles management team declared a code red when ChatGPT was released. Google has had a stranglehold on the search engine business for as long as most of us can remember. There are fears that users will now turn to the chatbot for help rather than filter through websites provided by Google. Anyone who has used Google knows you have to sift through websites when looking for information. On the other hand, ChatGPT aims to offer quick and direct responses to specific problems, even if the questions are complex.\nGoogle has plans to release 20 new AI products and share a version of its search engine with a chatbot feature. The biggest issue with a chatbot for Google is that roughly 80% of the companys revenue still comes from delivering digital ads. Google is also worried about safety, misinformation, and the factual accuracy of the chatbot.\nThere are rumors that Microsoft plans on adding a component of the chatbot to the Bing search engine. Google has hesitated to release a competing product, likely due to concerns over damaging its established brand reputation.\nThe education system\nThere are concerns from teachers about plagiarism since the chatbot can write an essay or create work from a few simple prompts. Many teachers have expressed worries about what this could mean for the education system. Some schools have already banned the tool, while others are brainstorming how to incorporate it into the classroom.\nGraphic design\nMany are worried that users will use AI-powered art tools to create art and graphics from text prompt"

If gains hold on Thursday, it would set up the shares for their biggest intraday surge in a decade and added more than $75.5 billion to its existing $401 billion market capitalization.\nZuckerberg described the focus on efficiency as part of the natural evolution of the company, calling it a \"phase change\" for an organization that once lived by the motto \"move fast and break things.\"\n\"We just grew so quickly for like the first 18 years,\" Zuckerberg said in a conference call. \"It's very hard to really crank on efficiency while you're growing that quickly. I just think we're in a different environment now.\"\nThe cost cuts reflect Meta's updated plans for lower data-center construction expenses this year as part of a shift to a structure that can support both AI and non-AI work, it said in a statement.\nThe digital ad giant faced a brutal 2022 as companies cut back on marketing spending due to economic worries, while rivals like TikTok captured younger users and Apple Inc's privacy updates continued to challenge the business of placing targeted ads.\nMeta in November cut more than 11,000 jobs in response, a precursor to the tens of thousands of\nlayoffs\nin the tech industry that followed.\n\"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization,\" Zuckerberg said in a statement.\nMonetization efficiency for Reels on Facebook, a short-form video format, had doubled in the past six months and the business was on track to roughly break even by the end of 2023 or early 2024 and grow profitably after that, he said on the conference call.\nInvestments starting to pay off\n\"Meta's better-than-feared results should refute concerns over the state of the digital advertising industry following Snap's horrible guidance earlier this week,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\"Despite all the challenges Meta must deal with, there are signs the business is still doing well,\" Cohen said.\nShares of peer Alphabet Inc were up 3.3% while Snap Inc stock rose 1% in after-hours trade on Wednesday.\nOn the conference call, executives said Meta's investments in AI-surfaced content and TikTok competitor Reels were starting to pay off. The company also has been using AI to increase automation for advertisers and target ads using less personal data, resulting in higher return on ad spend.\nMeta forecast first-quarter revenue between $26 billion and $28.5 billion. That was in with analysts' average estimates of $27.14 billion, according to Refinitiv.\nZuckerberg said generative AI - technology for producing original prose, imagery or computer code on command - would be the company's other big theme for this year, alongside efficiency.\nMeta was planning to launch several new products that would \"empower creators to be way more productive and creative,\" he said, while cautioning about the cost associated with supporting the technology for a large user base.\nHowever, net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31 fell to $4.65 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with $10.29 billion, or $3.67 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.22 per share.\nThe decline was largely due to a $4.2 billion charge related to cost-cutting moves such as layoffs, office closures and the data center strategy overhaul.\nThe company previously said it was planning to account for much of that cost in 2023.\nStart a Conversation\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nFacebook"

    "body": "Emily Henderson, B.Sc.\nFeb 1 2023\nA doctor needs a great deal of experience, knowledge and years of training to be able to expertly analyze an ECG. Automated procedures based on AI can offer effective support here. And an AI system in this field also has to be trained.\nThis is namely undertaken (in this case) with very large amounts of high-quality ECG data. Such training means that, for instance, even the smallest abnormalities in ECGs can be found and that reliable data can then be used to make a diagnosis. But what are the high-quality data that are needed for this? And how do we know if an AI system is reliable or not? These are the questions that PTB is going to address in the TEF Health project. Daniel Schwabe, one of PTB's researchers, is heading a dynamic project team made up of experts from PTB, the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications and the TV AI Lab. This team is responsible for work packages focusing on \"Standards and Quality\" and \"Certification\". \"PTB wants to use this project to significantly advance the quality assurance of data as the foundation of AI systems in medicine,\" explains Dr. Schwabe. \"This will mean that we can create a basis for using AI in a trustworthy way within the EU,\" adds Prof. Tobias Schffter. He is the head of PTB's Medical Physics and Metrological Information Technology Division, who initiated the project group and is accompanying it strategically.\nProviding trust in measurements  that is what PTB fundamentally stands for. And it does this by evaluating the quality of measurements and data sets. PTB will also guarantee reliability in the digital metrology of the future. It will do this by evaluating data and explaining algorithms which will then contribute to certifying artificial intelligence. PTB is working with other central players in the field of quality infrastructure in Germany (BAM, DAkkS, DIN, DKE). Together they are bringing forward a quality infrastructure that is digitally transformed, interoperable and geared to the future  and that is QI Digital. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) brought the QI Digital project into being. AI in medicine is one of three central themes in the German initiative, and this means that it will cooperate closely with the European TEF Health project.\nPractically speaking, digital data in medicine can never be measured and evaluated as individual values. Instead, complex systems of measurement procedures and sensors more often have to be understood and characterized. Thinking holistically and cross-contextually is crucial too. And this is also something that will be required by metrology and the testing systems that have to guarantee trust, reliability and security in the future. Just as the international prototypes of the meter and the kilogram served as the standards for metrology in the past, so should the quality standards for networked data and AI be traceable to quantities which can be measured. This research will be advanced at PTB within the scope of an innovation cluster that is currently addressing three thematic fields: Smart Mobility, the Smart City and Smart Health.\nThe TEF Health project\nZebrafish models shed light on Shigella infection\nThe EU's TEF Health project takes into account the breathtaking speed of technical advancements in AI and robotics in various fields including the healthcare sector. A total of 51 institutions are involved in TEF Health (with TEF standing for Testing and Experimenting Facilities). They are going to test novel approaches to AI in environments that are close to reality. This applies to new software, such as that used when diagnosing patients, and it also applies to intelligent devices that work directly on or even inside patients  such as surgical robots, carebots or intelligent implants. Apart from this, new regulatory requirements  like standardized test protocols  will be drawn up within the scope of the project. For this reason, not only leading hospitals and medical establishments (such as the Charit in Berlin and the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm) along with industrial research institutes are represented in this project.\nRegulatory bodies like TV and, not least, national metrology institutes such as PTB and its French counterpart LNE are on board too. The project is led by Prof. Dr. Petra Ritter of the Charit  Universittsmedizin Berlin. One important long-term goal of TEF Health is to establish sustainable collaborations between the economy, academic research and other players. The newly created evaluation resources and infrastructures will be available to industry in the form of services in the future. This will make it possible for us to employ AI in healthcare for the whole of Europe, and this AI will be trustworthy and secure as well as having been tested.\nSource:"

    "body": "Facebook and Instagram owner Meta on Wednesday reported its first annual sales drop since the company went public in 2012, but the fall was less brutal than expected, sending its share price soaring.The social media giant said sales dropped one percent to $116.6 billion in 2022, while it also announced that the number of daily users on Facebook hit two billion for the first time.CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg pointed to the success of improved algorithms on Meta's video Reels service, that was delivering short clips more efficiently to users on Facebook and Instagram.Meta competes fiercely with TikTok, the Chinese owned video-sharing platform that has proved a formidable rival in attracting young users away from once-dominant Instagram.\"The number of people daily using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is the highest it's ever been,\" Zuckerberg said in an earnings call.Zuckerberg also lauded improved artificial intelligence (AI) to better distribute ads after changes on the iPhone decided by Apple seriously hampered Meta's ability to target users.The 2022 results ended a bad year for Meta, which in November announced it would lay off 11,000 employees or 13 percent of staff in the largest worker reduction in the company's history.Zuckerberg said his company's \"management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\"Zuckerberg said Meta is working on eliminating layers of middle management as well as deploying AI tools to help engineers be more productive.Meta will also be more aggressive when it comes to cutting projects that are not performing or are not priorities, he added.Big tech platforms have been suffering from the souring economic climate, which is forcing advertisers to cut back on marketing, and Apple's data privacy changes, which have reduced leeway for ad personalization.But Meta beat market expectations as the effect of iPhone privacy changes on ad targeting appeared to be waning and cost-cutting started bringing results, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a tweet.\"At first glance... Meta getting its mojo back,\" Baird Equity Research said in a note to investors about the earnings report.Apple sent shockwaves through the industry in 2021 when it began inviting iPhone users to opt out of having their online activity tracked by apps for the purpose of targeting ads.This dealt a punishing blow to Facebook and Instagram that depend on super-targeted advertising for revenue.Meta last year said Apple's policy, which impacts the precision of the ads it sells and thus their price, would cost the social media giant $10 billion in lost revenue in 2022.Apple's iPhones hold about 55 percent of the smartphone market in the United States and about one third of smartphone users in Europe, the world's biggest ad markets.The company is also under pressure for making a huge gamble on the metaverse, the world of virtual reality that Meta believes will be the next frontier online.The bet however has yet to pay off with Meta's Reality Labs, the division that builds the necessary VR headsets and software, posting an operating loss of $4.28 billion in the last quarter of 2022. This followed big losses in the previous quarters.\"With losses at its VR division mounting, Mark Zuckerberg is going to have to accept an unfortunate reality: Virtual worlds are simply not what businesses or consumers want right now,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Debra Aho Williamson.Investors last year punished Meta, sending the company's share price down by an astonishing two thirds over 12 months, but the stock has recovered some of the ground in 2023.In after-hours trading, Meta's share price was up more than 19 percent to $182.83"

At the Union Budget, Nirmala Sitharaman, Indian Finance Minister, highlighted the importance of amplifying the vision of Make AI in India and Make AI Work for India. I believe AI will change the face of India and enable the country to establish a stronger foundation of a \"Digital India\". For a country to maximise the benefits of AI, it will be essential for the public and private sectors to work together to ensure that the use of AI will align with the country's values and priorities and to address the ethical, legal and social implications of AI, Amit Relan, founder and CEO, mFilterIt, a software company, told FE Blockchain. According to Sitharaman, three AI-based centres of excellence will be set up at top educational institutions of the country. The initiative is expected to involve leading industry players in interdisciplinary research, for creation of technologies to ensure betterment of sectors such as agriculture, health, and sustainable cities. As stated by Chetan Rexwal, co-founder, Ekank Technologies, a storytelling technology platform, Budget 2023 intends to show the potential of Indian government towards technology and innovation. The reduction of compliances will help startups to flourish more. I believe the Union Budget in the past has boosted the entrepreneurial spirit by taking a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results, he added. Insights from the Economic Survey emphasised on the importance of digital technology-based economic reforms for technological progress at a socio-economic level. Moreover, the survey showed estimates that electronic exports between April-November, 2023, will reach a value worth $13.8 billion, in comparison to $8.9 billion for the same period last year. The national AI portal has been developed with a view to strengthening the AI ecosystem in the country by pooling together and highlighting the latest developments happening in Central and State Governments, industry, academia, NGOs, and civil societies. As on 16 January 2023, it has published 1724 articles, 829 news items, 276 videos, 127 research reports, and 120 government initiatives, all related to AI, the survey mentioned. Mahin Gupta, founder, Liminal, a digital wallet infrastructure platform, is of the opinion that public digital infrastructure for the agriculture sector under an open-source standard will revolutionise the industry. By harnessing the power of 5G, Web3.0, and metaverse technologies, GDP growth can be accelerated by a significant percentage, Gupta noted.

On Tuesday, Netflix reinvigorated that fear when it debuted a short film called Dog and Boy that utilizes AI image synthesis to help generate its background artwork.\nFurther Reading\nBegone, polygons: 1993s Virtua Fighter gets smoothed out by AI\nDirected by Ryotaro Makihara, the three-minute animated short follows the story of a boy and his robotic dog through cheerful times, although the story soon takes a dramatic turn toward the post-apocalyptic. Along the way, it includes lush backgrounds apparently created as a collaboration between man and machine, credited to \"AI (+Human)\" in the end credit sequence.\nA still image from the short film Dog and Boy that features AI-assisted background art.\nNetflix\nA still image from the short film Dog and Boy that features AI-assisted background art.\nNetflix\nIn the announcement tweet, Netflix cited an industry labor shortage as the reason for using the image synthesis technology:\nAs an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!\nNetflix and the production company\nWIT Studio\ntapped Japanese AI firm Rinna for assistance with generating the images. They did not announce exactly what type of technology Rinna used to generate the artwork, but the process looks similar to a Stable Diffusion-powered \"img2img\" process than can take an image and transform it based on a written prompt.\nThe film is currently available to view for free on YouTube.\nAdvertisement\nNetflix's official Dog and Boy promotional video.\nAlmost immediately, Twitter users responded with a torrent of negative replies to Netflix's tweet announcing the film, such as, \"\nI know a ton of animators looking for work if you guys are struggling to find them (are you looking very hard?).\n\" Several others quoted legendary Studio Ghibli animator Hayao Miyazaki as saying that AI-powered art \"is an insult to life itself.\"\n\"Image generation technology\"? Just say you stole artists work through an AI gen and then claimed a labour shortage even though people like me and my brother who have degrees can't get jobs because there's 500 other graduates also trying to get an interview per application. Liars\n Reece Alex Burton //39k of 80k Draft// (@ReeceAlexBurton)\nFebruary 1, 2023\nIn a news release, Netflix expressed its hopes that the new technology would assist with future animation productions (translated by Google Translate): \"As a studio, Netflix focuses on supporting creators in the creation of works on a daily basis.

The Netflix release quoted him as saying, \"By combining tools and hand-drawn techniques, we can create something unique to humans ... I think that the core of the story is 'drawing a human being.' I think that it will be possible to secure and return to its roots, which will eventually strengthen the strengths of Japanese animation and expand its possibilities.\"\nLabor shortage or not, AI assistance may possibly speed up production times and lower production costs, allowing the creation of more animated content than ever before. But will people be happy about it? That remains to be seen."

    "body": "12.33PM, 02 February 2023\nSource: @crepprotect / Instagram.\nWith a flurry of blue and a glint of silver, Tiffany & Co. and Nike this week revealed a highly-limited set of Air Force 1 sneakers, decked out with the jewellers signature hue. But what critics saw was all that black: while the footwear giant was granted access to Tiffanys palette, the final product is largely fashioned from plain black suede. If it werent for the bespoke lettering on the tongue, a tiny metal ingot adorning the heel, or a US$400 ($560) price tag, the shoe could have come from a regular production run, some onlookers claimed.\nPerhaps expectations were skewed. Visual artists cooked up alternatives days before the big reveal, posting virtual mock-ups with robins-egg blue splashed from lace to heel, speculating that something altogether more daring was in the works.\nThen came the AI interpretations. Taking to Twitter after the official launch, Michael Miraflor, a fashion branding expert for US venture capital fund Hannah Grey, suggested it was this tide of fantastical, computer-generated imagery which made the real thing feel like a missed opportunity. There were *so many* good and interesting/provocative takes on what the Tiffanys x Nike collab had the potential to release, he wrote, that the actual product once revealed was a bit underwhelming.\nMiraflor posted a series of these AI-generated images, each showing a version of the shoe which never was. The broad intention was to show that technology is capable of producing feasible, even desirable, consumer goods, and that brands ought to consider the power of AI when designing their latest products. Its not fair to judge the actual product (for which a ton of work was no doubt put in by both brands) against the whimsical output of AI prompt engineers/artists, he added, but as AI art goes mainstream and people continue to play with brand IP expectations will have to be considered.\nGet daily business news.\nSubscribe\nYou'll also receive messages on behalf of our partners. You can opt-out at any time.\nHe is right, in one sense: its not fair to judge the final product against its AI competitors. That is because the real sneakers are better. Even the most boring consumer product, designed either by humans or a focus group full of them, is inherently filled with more creative energy than a computer-generated clone.\nObservation about Generative AI and consumer brand expectations:\nThere were *so many* good and interesting / provocative AI takes on what the Tiffany's x Nike collab had the potential to release that the actual product once revealed was a bit underwhelming.\nJanuary 31, 2023\nThere is no accounting for taste, but the imagery shared online, originally cooked up by NFT creator @rickdick__, does showcase the current limit of todays generative technology. It appears the programs used have only a cursory handle on how shoelaces operate, and entrusting AI to design footwear is inherently problematic so long as it assumes the average person has at least 12 fingers. Even so, the problems go beyond the ugliness and impracticality of those AI mockups. It is totally feasible the next wave of updates will learn to tie its own laces, making aesthetic critiques easy, but futile. In truth, the future of AI-generated fashion feels entirely more depressing than those weird, rubbery cartoons.\nIndependent Australian fashion designers already rail against larger companies pilfering their designs, with little legal recourse available in cases where small businesses have not trademarked each distinct pattern they produce. As in AI startups that draw portraits in the style of any artist, it is foreseeable that AI-generated fashion of the future will simply ingest imagery, videos, and trending TikToks to churn out the latest designs, training itself on massive data sets which flatten the work of individual designers. It is already hard enough for small labels to challenge the fast fashion giants. What will that process look like, when those brands can plausibly deny that any human plagiarised a design?\nRead more\nThe supposed inevitability of AI designs may also misunderstand what it is, exactly, that makes an object desirable. For better or worse, the Tiffany x Nike sneaker is destined to sell out near-instantly, and not through any fresh design additions. The Air Force 1 is already one of the most famous and beloved sneaker silhouettes of all time, while Tiffanys brand cachet alone is enough to propel extremely expensive luxury goods into the hyper-sphere.\nFashion critics have long lamented how streetwear aesthetics are now anything but street, with each seasons trends emerging like papal edicts from high-end retailers. Tiffany & Co. and Nike no doubt are contributors to the modern-day hype cycle themselves. Yet AI generation removes even this form of desirability.\nIt is one thing to have a defined style emerge organically from a subculture, but even a shred of authenticity exists in the Air Force 1, a basketball shoe that morphed into a daily-wear classic. The source of AI style is everything and nothing. It is intrinsically formless. Expecting consumers to spend their hard-earned money on the ghosts of good design, and for them to desire those products, is insulting.\nA post shared by Crep Protect (@crepprotect)\nIt is understandable why Miraflor, and even casual observers, are intrigued by the promise of AI style. Its output is intriguing, at the very least, and there does at least exist the potential for real-world designers to use those tools as a sounding board for ideas. Nike itself is playing around the edges of the space with its NFT offering. Yet the fashion icons which modern consumers hold in the highest esteem earned their status in the real world after users imposed their own meaning upon them. AI cant solve that.\nPerhaps a deeper look at Nikes back catalogue gets the point across. This isnt the brands first collaboration with Tiffany & Co.  officially, at least. In 2005, skateboarding brand Diamond Supply Co. worked with Nike SB, the companys skate division, on a performance shoe co-opting the jewellers colour scheme. The Diamond Dunks, released without any OK from Tiffanys, became a cult hit. They remain some of the most desirable sneakers Nike has ever released. It was the contrast between high fashion and skateboarding which made the idea so compelling, and the chaotic mix of luxe aesthetics slamming onto asphalt. AI cant manage that. It wont. Instead, it will conjure fantasies unlikely to ever touch the ground."

Become an Insider and start reading now.\nMeta reported a 4% year-over-year decline in ad revenue, but beat Wall Street's estimates.\nMeta's ad chief Marne Levine told Insider that AI will play a bigger role boosting advertisers' creative.\nMeta is also exploring new ways to make money from short-form video Reels.\nMeta's rebuilt ad business has seen early success after it took a $10 billion hit last year thanks to Apple's privacy update. The company now faces advertisers slashing budget due to economic uncertainty.\nMeta reported a third consecutive revenue decline (down 4% year-over-year to $32.2 billion) during its fourth-quarter earnings call due to those pullbacks.\n\"There is a general feeling of uncertainty because the context is changing week-to-week,\" Marne Levine, chief business officer for Meta, told Insider. She added that advertisers still are focused on driving growth despite these economic contraints.\nWhile Meta advertisers might be pulling back because of the economy, Meta still has an advantage over other digital ad platforms. Advertisers have said that as they cut spend in other channels this year, they're still focusing on tried-and-true platforms like Meta.\nThey also want to prove their ad investments led to results.\nMeta said that artificial intelligence helped advertisers achieve 20% more conversions during the fourth quarter compared to the same time period last year.\nLevine said a feature called Advantage+ that uses Meta's AI to find relevant audiences for ads is paying off, with recent tests showing that the tool increased return on ad spend by 32%. Advantage+ also has a $4 billion annual run rate, Levine said.\nLevine said Meta is using artificial intelligence to help advertisers test creative  like where text should go on an ad, the brightness of an ad, and what size an ad should be.\n\"Advertisers can get smarter [and] faster on what campaign creative combinations drive the best results,\" she said.\nMeta wants to grow Reels and is testing shopping ads\nMeta's short-form video feature Reels is also gaining traction but hasn't been broadly adopted by advertisers yet. Meta said that 40% of its advertisers use Reels, and Levine said that playthroughs of Reels videos across Facebook and Instagram have doubled over the past year.\nTo increase the monetization of Reels, Levine said Meta is working on improving the relevancy of Reels that users see, creating new templates for advertisers to make Reels, and developing new formats like commerce-based Reels units.\nMeta is also testing shopping ads that allow advertisers to send clicks directly to their own e-commerce sites, or to the Shop section on Facebook and Instagram where people buy directly through Meta. Meta then takes a cut of revenue.\n\"It's still early, but we're excited by what it is that we're seeing here,\" Levine said.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

    "body": "Copy article link\nSave\nThe recent emergence of artificial intelligence programs that can write essays automatically poses a new and unique challenge for educators, area school leaders say.\nSome public school districts  notably New York City Schools, the nations largest district  have already banned or strictly limited use of AI text generators such as the increasingly popular ChatGPT.\nMid-Atlantic Christian University President John Maurice cited an observation by MACU Vice President of Academic Affairs Kevin Larsen that AI essay writers are scary because of their capacity to elude the usual methods for detecting plagiarism.\nSeveral free online programs have emerged recently that will write an essay based on relatively simple input from the user  starting with as little as a suggested title.\nThe programs are surprisingly capable, though still subject to making mistakes. For instance, a test of one of the online AI services by a Daily Advance staff member yielded a sample article about the Hertford waterfront that included a number of relevant and accurate statements about the topic but also mistakenly identified the town as being located on the Neuse River.\nSome educators do fear the technology could pose a genuine threat to academic integrity.\nAI is something totally different, Larsen said in his response to a query from Maurice about the technology. We dont have a way to detect this yet.\nLarsen suggested that the only way AI might be suspected of being used would be if ones writing of papers was far superior than the writing of essays on exams.\nMACU does have access to a plagiarism detector that spots cut and paste use of sources, Larsen said.\nBut AI will produce a totally unique paper, Larsen said, so the detector wouldnt spot it. You can give the same parameters and it will produce a completely unique paper each time.\nWe do have protocols for academic dishonesty, Larsen continued. But detecting the use of AI isnt there yet.\nThis week it was reported that modest progress has begun on the detection front.\nThe creators of ChatGPT, partly in response to educators concerns, have now developed technology to help detect AI-generated text, according to an Associated Press report. The developers acknowledge that the detection tool is not a fail-safe, but it has been designed to determine the relative likelihood that an essay or exam answer might be AI-generated.\nCollege of The Albemarle spokeswoman Tammy Sawyer said COA is aware of the challenges posed by the app and is in the early stages of addressing them.\nCollege of The Albemarles instructors currently use Turnitin to check student work for plagiarism, Sawyer said. We are currently looking into options that will also check for the use of AI programs.:\nShe noted that Turnitin has said its software is being refined with AI detection in mind. However, the process is an iterative one and is continually evolving.\nThis is a developing area of awareness and concern that we are monitoring closely, Sawyer said.\nCamden County Schools Superintendent Joe Ferrell said the district does not currently have protocols established for dealing with the prospect of students using, or attempting to use, AI programs to write papers for class.\nFerrell, who is departing Camden later this month to become superintendent of the Richmond County Schools, said if the school district decides the issue needs to be addressed with a policy, the usual process would begin with a check with the N.C. School Boards Association.\nThe School Boards Association does a great job with that, Ferrell said.\nThe Associated Press reported this week that educators thinking about ChatGPT is evolving quickly.\nThe initial reaction was OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT, said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that this is the future and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\nI think we would be nave if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power, said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the companys detection service is in place.\nFacebook"

    "body": "Comment(0)\nThere is deep concern among technology experts as Artificial Intelligence (AI), one of the emerging technologies, cuts short thousands of workforce in various professions across the world. A tool of AI technology, known as ChatGPT, is built with potentiality to replace numerous jobs as it possesses capabilities that are similar to human intelligence. Since it was released in November, last year, the sophisticated chatbot, which is freely available to the public, has already upended some jobs in certain professions especially in technology ecosystem. This has resulted in Microsoft laying off of 10,000 staff and choosing to invest billions into the chatbox technology instead.\nBased on this, experts have continued to be worried that the applications popularity and usage could potentially affect many well-paid workers. An Associate Dean in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology, Pengcheng Shi, told the New York Post that AI is replacing the white-collar workers. I dont think anyone can stop that.\nAccording to the experts, the growing ChatGPT technology will affect professions such as journalism in the aspect of News-gathering, although it has trouble in making a name for itself correctly as it produces mixed results. The technology is perfect in copy editing , summarizing and creating headlines.\nIt does a great job of summarising, condensing an article, and other related tasks. Additionally, the tool excels at creating headlines. With this, there may be no need for the service of a copy editor in newspaper company. ChinmayHegde, a professor at NYU, argues that website designers and engineers responsible for very simple coding are at risk of becoming redundant. He noted that AI may create a code that is hand-tailored to a users demands and parameters to build websites and other IT components. Finance, healthcare, and publishing are among the vulnerable businesses.\nHumans will discover how to utilize AI as it continues to make incredible progress. More jobs may also be affected in academics as the tool can instruct students in middle or high school. For instance, ChatGPT surpassed several people during an MBA exam taken by Penns Wharton School. After Darren Hick, a philosophy professor at Furman University in South Carolina detected a student cheating with the popular program, he remarked that the finding left him in abject horror. According to Shi, relatively uncomplicated software design jobs will be a thing of the past by 2026 or sooner. As time goes on, probably today or the next three, five, 10 years, those software engineers, if their job is to know how to code  I dont think they will be broadly needed. However, the tool has some limitations currently, although it is likely there will be advancements coming up. In the meantime, ChatGPT has bugs and inaccuracies in terms of knowledge, but can be easily improved as it is just needed to be trained. Doctoral candidates hoping for a shortcut to create a thesis may not be lucky as the tool is beyond AIs abilities for the time being. The tool has inability to fact-check efficiently as well as inability to provide accurate citations: It can easily provide an essay but with made-up citations. However, there is panic in Nigeria that many jobs could be lost in the coming years if the technology finds its way in Nigeria as bots like ChatGPT continues to improve. Stakeholders are worried that the technology if adopted in the country will worsen the unemployment disaster in the country.\nTRY IT TONIGHT!!! ---\nAbuja Civil Servant reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that Increased his Manh0d size, gives Stronger Erections and ends Premature Erection in 7days..."

    "body": "OpenAI\nhas launched a tool for detecting text generated using services like its own ChatGPT.\nGenerative AI models used for services like ChatGPT have raised many societal and ethical questions: Could they be used to generate misinformation on an unprecedented scale? What if students cheat using them? Should an AI be credited where excerpts are used for articles or papers?\nA paper (PDF) from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism even found that GPT-3 is able to generate influential text that has the potential to radicalise people into far-right extremist ideologies.\nOpenAI was founded to promote and develop friendly AI that benefits humanity. As the creator of powerful generative AI models like GPT and DALL-E, OpenAI has a responsibility to ensure its creations have safeguards in place to prevent  or at least minimise  their use for harmful purposes.\nThe new tool launched this week claims to be able to distinguish text written by a human from that of an AI (not just GPT). However, OpenAI warns that its currently unreliable.\nOn a challenge set of English texts, OpenAI says its tool only identifies 26 percent of AI-written text as likely AI-written. The tool falsely classifies human-written text around nine percent of the time.\nWhile it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text, we believe good classifiers can inform mitigations for false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human: for example, running automated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty, and positioning an AI chatbot as a human, says OpenAI.\n[The tool] should not be used as a primary decision-making tool, but instead as a complement to other methods of determining the source of a piece of text.\nOther key limitations of the tool are that its very unreliable on short texts under 1,000 characters and its significantly worse when applied to non-English texts.\nOpenAI originally provided access to GPT to a small number of trusted researchers and developers. While it developed more robust safeguards, a waitlist was then introduced. The waitlist was removed in November 2021 but work on improving safety is an ongoing process.\nTo ensure API-backed applications are built responsibly, we provide tools and help developers use best practices so they can bring their applications to production quickly and safely, wrote OpenAI in a blog post.\nAs our systems evolve and we work to improve the capabilities of our safeguards, we expect to continue streamlining the process for developers, refining our usage guidelines, and allowing even more use cases over time.\nOpenAI recently shared his view that there is too much hype around GPTs next major version, GPT-4, and that people are begging to be disappointed. He also believes that a video-generating model will come, but wont put a timeframe on when.\nVideos that have been manipulated with AI technology, also known as deepfakes, are already proving to be problematic. People are easily convinced by what they think they can see.\nWeve seen deepfakes of figures like disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to commit fraud, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to disinform, and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to defame and make her appear drunk.\nOpenAI is doing the right thing by taking its time to minimise risks, keeping expectations in check, and building tools for uncovering content that falsely claims to have been created by a human.\nYou can test OpenAIs work-in-progress tool for detecting AI-generated text here. An alternative called DetectGPT is being created by Stanford University researchers and is available to demo here.\n(Photo by Shane Aldendorff on\n)\nRelated: OpenAI opens waitlist for paid version of ChatGPT\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

All three models come with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 flagship-grade chipset designed for Android phones, offering significant CPU and GPU gains over its predecessors.\nSamsung retains the display sizes and resolutions of its new Galaxy S models, with a 6.1-inch S23, a 6.6-inch S23+, and 6.8-inch S23 Ultra. All are Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display panels with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, have 120Hz maximum refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate while in Game Mode, with an improved Vision Boosterfeature (three levels of sunlight visibilityinstead of two, for better anti-glare) and Enhanced Comfort built-in (colour tone and contrast adjustment for easier reading).\nOnly the Galaxy S23 Ultra, however, gets 1Hz minimum refresh rate (the other two are 48Hz) and a QHD+ resolution screen (others are FHD+). This model also gets a mildly tweaked curved display when compared to the S23 Ultra, now having a reduced curvature for an even larger and flatter surface area for viewing. The other two phones (S23 and S23+) have flat panels instead.\nWhat wasnt retained was the old Contour Cut design. The Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23+ now share the same camera housing design as its premium S23 Ultra sibling, with individual lens rims highlighting their rear multi-camera configurations.\nSamsung placed great effort into improving the imaging experience of its Galaxy S series with many enhancements, with the Galaxy S23 Ultra getting special treatment. Across the board, all models get Adaptive VDIS (video digital image stabilisation), AI-assisted Noise Reduction Technology, and a new, celestial photography-friendly Astro Hyperlapse(300x)setting found in its old Hyperlapse mode, and improved 50MP support for Expert RAW uncompressed photography (up from 12MP, requires optional Samsung Expert RAW app).\nBoth Galaxy S23 and S23+ retain their triple-rear camera offering, with a 50-megapixel (MP) main camera, 12MP ultra-wide, and 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom support.\nGalaxy S23 Ultra keeps its quad rear shooter combo, but amps up its main camera to 200MP with 16-in-1 pixel binning techniques (Super Quad Pixel) to milk its low-light Nightography capabilities. S23 Ultra also get double the optical image stabilisation (OIS) angles for videos and 8K30FPS with 80 field-of-view (up from 57).\nAll three models 12MP front camera gets Super HDR support, giving selfies even more colour mastery. And, if you happen to have the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, all three can record 360 Audio, giving recorded videos more audio depth.\nFinally, the Galaxy S23 and 23+ get 200mAh more battery than before, at 3,900mAh and 4,700mAh respectively; Galaxy S23 Ultra retains its 5,000mAh.\nCharging, however, is slightly different across all three devices, with S23 getting wired 25W fast-charging, while S23+ and Ultra get 45W instead. All three also offer wireless fast-charging and Wireless PowerShare.\nThe official spec sheets claim that the phones support Wi-Fi 6E (dependent on market availability), Bluetooth 5.3, 5G, andLTE connectivity. Like before, they are all rated IP68-resistant against water and dust. This new series is also Samsungs most ambitious attempt at using recycled materials for phones, with an even wider variety of recycled aluminium, glass, and post-consumer plastics used. Their packaging also uses 100% recycled paper.\nThe entire Samsung Galaxy S23 series come in four colours  Phantom Black, Cream, Green, and Lavender. Pre-orders in Singapore begin on 2 February 2023, with their official release on 17 February 2023. Prices start at S$1,118 (Galaxy S23, 128GB), S$1,528 (Galaxy S23+, 256GB), and S$1,828 (Galaxy S23 Ultra, 256GB).\n"

Microsoft would beg to differ. The new Teams Premium tier not only includes the usual unlimited messages and better organizational tools, its adding exclusive powers enabled by OpenAIs GPT 3.5 language model. The new tier will be $10 per month per user starting on June 30th, but you can get a cheaper preview for $7 until then.\nWhat does the fancy AI do? Its mostly one headline feature, intelligent recap. This tool can watch meetings with Teams video feature and automatically generate meeting notes and recommended tasks, as well as a full transcription of whats spoken in the meeting and by whom. Itll also generate automatic chapter divides for recorded meetings, though at launch it only works if you use PowerPoint Live  which seems like something you could do without resorting to prodigious AI number-crunching.\nPremium users will also be able to apply watermarks to Teams video and select which participants can record and which cannot, combining with sensitivity labels to create a larger focus on privacy and security. Less notable additions include expanded webinar tools and more robust alerts for meetings.\nAs noted by The Verge, the new Premium tier is also stealing some features away from the previous paid tier ($4 per user per month). Live translations for captions in 40 languages will remain on the bottom tier for the next 60 days, but will then be exclusive to Premium. Company-wide custom backgrounds and virtual appointments are also on the chopping block for less lucrative users.\nGPT-powered additions to Teams are only the latest in the companys wave of AI-infused tools. Microsofts Designer program uses extensive AI-generated art for publishing, and the company has been experimenting with ChatGPT in its Bing browser, among other pushes. Seeing all of these AI-powered additions to Microsoft software is a reminder of some of its less people-friendly actions as of late, like hosting an exclusive Sting concert for executives just a few hours before announcing 10,000 job cuts."

GPT-3.5  is the latest version of the model.\nIn January, Microsoft announced the third phase of its long-term partnership with OpenAI, with a multiyear, multibillion dollar investment from the tech giant meant to help accelerate breakthroughs in AI, and the ability for Microsoft to access new AI-based capabilities it can resell or build into its products.\nOn February 1, OpenAI announced that it was piloting a subscription plan called Chat GPTPlus. The $20 monthly plan will give users priority access to the chatbot, including faster response times and guaranteed reliability during peak hours  times when users of the free version may have access blocked due to the load on the system.\nIn addition to the AI capabilities underpinned by GPT-3.5, the premium version of Microsoft Teams will offers users advanced security features, such as the ability to watermark meetings, turn on end-to-end encryption for meetings with more than 50 participants, and add sensitivity labels for virtual meetings that will prevent participants from copying and pasting meeting chats.\nUsers will also be able to turn on live translation for captions from 40 languages, while customers hosting webinars will have access to advanced capabilities such as registration waitlist and manual approval, separate virtual greenrooms for presenters and attendees before an event begins, and the option to better manage what attendees see  allowing them to only see shared content and participants you bring on-screen, for example\nRelated:"

But to truly transform and remain competitive in this industry, more intelligent approaches on the factory floor are necessary. Up until recently, the process of detecting defects in product coming off press machines remained largely a manual one where humans would physically pick up metal sheets and flip or turn them multiple times while visually inspecting the material. Not only has this been inefficient, but its also has been difficult to do accurately because of the metals reflectivity, varying surface characteristics, and the all the different molds used for pressing.Compared to human inspectors, automated optical inspection (AOI) systems can dramatically improve productivity and accuracy, and reduce operational costs of defect detection.\nLearn about the solution from ASUSTek Computer Inc. that provides an easy-to-use toolchain and software development kit (SDK) for developing AI model training and inferencing software used in machine vision applications.\nSponsor"

    "body": "update\nArticle was updated 10 hrs ago\nSam Yang likes creating art, making a living off what he creates and teaching it. What he doesnt like is people using artificial intelligence programs to emulate his style.\nSo in a bid to stop people from using their work, Yang and other artists have raised concerns about a surge over the past year in people doing just that.\nRecently, the use of such technology to create images and text has raised many ethical questions about who is employing it and how. For Torontos Yang, it became a concern when he discovered a number of people using image fragments from as many as 300 of his works to create derivative AI images.\nMy content is not to be used for commercialized purposes. I am the owner of this copyright, Yang told the Star.\nArt is Yangs career: hes a digital artist who works from home, drawing every day to sell illustrations for educational and commercial purposes. He also spreads his passion via his YouTube channel, Sam Does Arts, where he gives art instruction to nearly a million subscribers; the internet has helped him gain a following but is also one reason for his problem.\nIt can seem as though AI software is creating the images from nothing, artists like Yang say. But in reality, it is assembling them using fragments of actual images gathered or scraped from the internet and stored in massive databases.\nTrained on the scraped images, algorithms called models are used to create new ones in a specific style via prompts typed by users. Some models arent just used but sold to people who want to create art in specific styles.\nAfter discovering a person was creating images via AI and posting them on the online forum Reddit, saying it was meant to look like Yangs work, Yang spoke up.\nI told people about this and how this was not right, Yang said, but those in the forum hit back.\nThey decided to retaliate and made a multitude of new models based on my work.\nThe AI-generated pieces were released to the public and a contest was held by Civitai, a company that shares models, to see who could best recreate Yangs style. He said those involved even asked him if he would judge the contest.\nCivitai sent Yang an email that he alleges was meant to taunt him.\nAs you may or may not be aware, (youre probably aware), it reads, your reaction to calling out this individual and his work created a Streisand effect, resulting in a slew of aspiring AI artists taking up the task of creating models in your style. SamDoesArts is now not only one of the most copied models but also the most downloaded.\nIn the event youre actually some kind of reverse psychology savant, and wanted this to happen to better spread your style (and marketing) then bravo, fantastic job! If not, well, unfortunate.\nCivitai told the Star in an email it had tried to contact Yang regarding his complaints about people using his work. It did not address the emails tone but pointed to its statements posted on Reddit as its official response to artists concerns.\nThe company said it has a complaint function on its platform called This uses my art for those who believe an image has been made from their work without permission. Once an artist fills that out, the statement said, the company will review the claim and it will be delisted if found to be credible.\nYang said he hasnt seen it happening. Thereve been many artists, in fact, report the models on this website and they still have not been taken down, he said.\nCivitais Reddit post says many people cannot afford the works made by artists and this gives them a chance to own something in the style of an artist they like. Of the proceeds, 70 per cent will go to the artist and/or model creator, reads the statement.\nYang insists theres nothing altruistic about the strategy.\nYoure kind of centralizing the power now, where the corporations hold all the power, he said. The individual artists are going to be screwed over.\nStories like Yangs have led to artists around the world rallying to fight for their copyrights and stem the use of their work by AI.\nJon Lam is a Vancouver artist who does storyboard work for video games, but defending the integrity of artists work has recently become another priority for him. He and other artists found some AI images that so blatantly scrape their art that fragments of the artists signatures can be seen in them.\nEverything that is on the internet, they are scraping it, Lam said.\nWith so much art in program databases, AI can easily come up with something that would appear to be unique, but is actually just cribbed and reassembled from artists creations, he said. Lam added that when theres not enough scraped art to draw from in a certain style, the programs start overusing certain images and the art all starts looking the same.\nNow, Lam and others have spoken to legal experts and plan to speak to politicians next month trying to stem the infringement of artists works, including via the hashtag #createdontscrape.\nBut the legalities around AI art are in a grey area in Canada, according to Victoria Fricke, a German lawyer studying law as a graduate student at McGill University.\nFricke said while the creators of the images own the copyright to them in Canada, there has yet to be a court case involving their use in AI imaging. So while there is some potential protection, it has yet to be tested in such a case in Canada.\nRELATED STORIES\nJan. 22, 2023\nThey can always sue for copyright infringement and for compensation, she said of artists. But, since no one did yet, we dont know how the courts will interpret that.\nLawyers who work in copyright are waiting for such a case, she said, adding that the question of who owns the copyright on the AI images is also unresolved.\nIn Northern California, the legal battles have already begun.\nIn January, a group of American artists launched a lawsuit against four AI software companies  Stability AI Ltd., Stability AI Inc., Midjourney Inc. and DeviantArt Inc. The suit alleges the companies have created products that infringe on the rights of artists and others.\nThe Star contacted all companies named in the suit but only received a response from Stability AI. Please note that we take these matters seriously, the statement from the company reads. Anyone that believes that this isnt fair use does not understand the technology and misunderstands the law.\nLam said he expects the proceedings in the U.S. to eventually have a trickle-down effect on the Canadian side of the issue, but he hopes Canada can help lead the charge. While he waits for any such effects to hit Canada, he said the intention is to continue pushing to raise awareness about the threat the software poses to artists.\nHe said the term AI is really being used as marketing; while current tech represents a threat to people like him it doesnt represent actual artificial intelligence.\nTrue artificial intelligence would be a computer being sentient, self-aware, waking up and deciding it wants to paint one day, La"

And on Monday of this week, it saw an especially large pop after the firm reported excellent fourth-quarter earnings. In 2022, higher interest rates and a slowing economic backdrop were supposed to hinder lending activity and consumer spending and, ultimately, diminish SoFIs revenue and user growth trajectory. But as weve seen from the companys second-, third-, and now fourth-quarter earnings results, that could not be less true. Were going to see a lot of AI stocks that were crushed in 2022 become the leaders of a 2023 resurgence. Welcome, folks, as we get ready for another installment of our weekly Hypergrowth Investing podcast, where we discuss all things investing, such as artificial intelligence (AI), electric vehicles (EVs), and more. We normally release these on Wednesday, but a scheduling hiccup prompted us to schedule for Thursday at 7:30 a.m. Make sure to tune in! If youve been following updates here or on our website, then its no secret that were super bulls when it comes to SoFi (SOFI). Indeed, last year, when the stock was languishing under $5, we called it the buy of a lifetime. Well, so far in 2023, even before we hit February, SoFi stock is already up 50%. And on Monday of this week, it saw an especially large pop after the firm reported excellent fourth-quarter earnings. Despite its rapid ascent this month, we still believe SoFi stock is the buy of a lifetime. In 2022, higher interest rates and a slowing economic backdrop were supposed to hinder lending activity and consumer spending and, ultimately, diminish SoFis revenue and user growth trajectory. But as weve seen from the companys second-, third-, and now fourth-quarter earnings results, that could not be less true. Now investors are seeing SoFis flawless execution in spite of the tough macro environment, and theyre getting excited. If the company can perform this well under these conditions, imagine what it can do when the macro meaningfully improves. This ongoing success speaks volumes about the importance of a robust management team  especially in an industry as competitive as fintech. SoFi is outperforming in a space with tons of room to grow. And thats why we think the stock will keep flying higher. How to Play AI Stocks This week, were revisiting an investment theme thats ensnared the worlds attention  AI. But it doesnt seem like the sector lends itself to transparent investment opportunities. So, how do we play this one? ChatGPT was the iPhone moment for the AI Revolution. Though the tech has been around, one consumer product in particular grabbed the worlds attention and showed them all the industrys possibilities. And that means were going to see a lot of AI stocks that were crushed in 2022 become the leaders of a 2023 resurgence. Take C3.ai (AI), for example. Its an enterprise AI software company that provides solutions for a lot of legacy firms, allowing companies to build out software similar to LEGO. C3.ai precodes several applications, and its customers can choose which aspects they want to integrate. The company has been growing rapidly and has a highly profitable business model with strong gross margins  yet it was crushed in 2022s anti-growth environment. Thats what were seeing in the space right now  lots of AI stocks with fantastic technologies that were beaten down for macro reasons and are now ready to rocket. Look for the companies using AI to drive real-world economic value, likely achieved through innovative software and hardware; think robotics and self-driving. We also discuss clean energy, EVs, and the housing boom in this weeks episode, which you can watch here now. On the date of publication, Seth Kuczinski did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article."

Im pretty confident that it wont be the case with Samsungs Ultra phone. It is much easier on the palms, and you are likely to get a good gaming experience as a result.\nGalaxy S23 Ultra initial impressions: 200MP camera and gaming\nApart from the design the other two departments Samsung is focusing on with the Galaxy S23 Ultra are the camera and gaming experience.\nStarting with the optics, the Galaxy S23 Ultra sports a new 200MP sensor that offers features like adaptive pixel, multi-exposure, astro hyperlapse, astrophoto, 8K videos at 30 FPS and more. In my brief time with the phone, I was only able to checkout the speed of autofocus and shutter lag in the 200MP camera mode.\nTo my surprise, the shutter lag is minimal when clicking photos in the highest resolution on offer. It focuses on objects quickly but the software takes a good few seconds to process the image in the gallery. However, you are still able to click multiple shots while the images you clicked get processed.\nThe 200MP camera sports a 3-degree OIS, which should translate to a better photography experience for those like me, with shaky hands. On the other hand, the 12MP front camera is now also capable of shooting RAW images.\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra is powered by a custom Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, which helps in gaming performance. While I didnt get the time to play mobile games on the device, Samsung promises features like ray tracing, AI-powered adaptive performance and adaptive vision booster.\nThe adaptive performance based on AI helps the phone to allocate appropriate resources as per the gaming requirements. It will be interesting to see how the phone handles gaming in longer durations. I have high hopes from it because the smartphone features a 2.7 times bigger vapour cooling chamber that should help keep the temperatures in check.\nGalaxy S23 Ultra specs\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra features a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity-O QHD+ display that supports a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, 500ppi density and a 1,750nit peak brightness. It looks sharp. As mentioned above, under the hood lies a custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset that is said to offer better performance than the rivals with the same chipset but without the custom magic.\nFor optics, the Galaxy S23 Ultra sports a quad-camera setup. It is led by a 200MP sensor with an f/1.7 aperture. The primary camera is accompanied by a 12MP ultra-wide-angle sensor, and two 10MP telephoto cameras for 3x and 10x optical zoom capabilities. You get the usual 100x digital zoom option as well. On the front lies a 12MP sensor.\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra packs a 5,000mAh battery that supports Super Fast Charging 2.0 and Fast Wireless Charging 2.0. It will be interesting to see how fast the 5,000mAh cell charges. Plus, you get the option to charge your earbuds or smartwatch by placing them on your phone through wireless power share.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is shaping up to be an exciting proposition for the flagship Android market.

    "body": "Share on Reddit\nOn Monday, a group of AI researchers from Google, DeepMind, UC Berkeley, Princeton, and ETH Zurich released a paper outlining an adversarial attack that can extract a small percentage of training images from latent diffusion AI image synthesis models like Stable Diffusion. It challenges views that image synthesis models do not memorize their training data and that training data might remain private if not disclosed.\nFurther Reading\nArtists file class-action lawsuit against AI image generator companies\nRecently, AI image synthesis models have been the subject of intense ethical debate and even legal action. Proponents and opponents of generative AI tools regularly argue over the privacy and copyright implications of these new technologies. Adding fuel to either side of the argument could dramatically affect potential legal regulation of the technology, and as a result, this latest paper, authored by Nicholas Carlini et al., has perked up ears in AI circles.\nHowever, Carlini's results are not as clear-cut as they may first appear. Discovering instances of memorization in Stable Diffusion required 175 million image generations for testing and preexisting knowledge of trained images. Researchers only extracted 94 direct matches and 109 perceptual near-matches out of 350,000 high-probability-of-memorization images they tested (a set of known duplicates in the 160 million-image dataset used to train Stable Diffusion), resulting in a roughly 0.03 percent memorization rate in this particular scenario.\nEnlarge\n/\nExample images that researchers extracted from Stable Diffusion v1.4 using a random sampling and membership inference procedure, with original images on the top row and extracted images on the bottom row.\nCarlini et al., 2023\nAlso, the researchers note that the \"memorization\" they've discovered is approximate since the AI model cannot produce identical byte-for-byte copies of the training images. By definition, Stable Diffusion cannot memorize large amounts of data because the size of the 160,000 million-image training dataset is many orders of magnitude larger than the 2GB Stable Diffusion AI model. That means any memorization that exists in the model is small, rare, and very difficult to accidentally extract.\nPrivacy and copyright implications\nStill, even when present in very small quantities, the paper appears to show that approximate memorization in latent diffusion models does exist, and that could have implications for data privacy and copyright. The results may one day affect potential image synthesis regulation if the AI models become considered \"lossy databases\" that can reproduce training data, as one AI pundit speculated. Although considering the 0.03 percent hit rate, they would have to be considered very, very lossy databasesperhaps to a statistically insignificant degree.\nAdvertisement\nWith Stable Diffusion, you may never believe what you see online again\nWhen training an image synthesis model, researchers feed millions of existing images into the model from a dataset, typically obtained from the public web. The model then compresses knowledge of each image into a series of statistical weights, which form the neural network. This compressed knowledge is stored in a lower-dimensional representation called \"latent space.\" Sampling from this latent space allows the model to generate new images with similar properties to those in the training data set.\nIf, while training an image synthesis model, the same image is present many times in the dataset, it can result in \"overfitting,\" which can result in generations of a recognizable interpretation of the original image. For example, the Mona Lisa has been found to have this property in Stable Diffusion. That property allowed researchers to target known-duplicate images in the dataset while looking for memorization, which dramatically amplified their chances of finding a memorized match.\nAlong those lines, the researchers also experimented on the top 1,000 most-duplicated training images in the Google Imagen AI model and found a much higher percentage rate of memorization (2.3 percent) than Stable Diffusion. And by training their own AI models, the researchers found that diffusion models have a tendency to memorize images more than GANs.\nFurther Reading\nArtist finds private medical record photos in popular AI training data set\nEric Wallace, one of the paper's authors, shared some personal thoughts on the research in a Twitter thread. As stated in the paper, he suggested that AI model-makers should de-duplicate their data to reduce memorization. He also noted that Stable Diffusion's model is small relative to its training set, so larger diffusion models are likely to memorize more. And he advised against applying today's diffusion models to privacy-sensitive domains like medical imagery.\nLike many academic papers, Carlini et al. 2023 is dense with nuance that could potentially be molded to fit a particular narrative as lawsuits around image synthesis play out, and the paper's authors are aware that their research may come into legal play. But overall, their goal is to improve future diffusion models and reduce potential harms from memorization: \"We believe that publishing our paper and publicly disclosing these privacy vulnerabilities is both ethical and responsible. Indeed, at the moment, no one appears to be immediately harmed by the (lack of) privacy of diffusion models; our goal with this work is thus to make sure to preempt these harms and encourage responsible training of diffusion models in the future.\""

In part, this was as a result of charges related to our restructuring efforts according the the companys release. Earlier it had also increased spending on the metaverse and on its short-form video content product Reels.\n2022 was a challenging year, said Mark Zuckerberg.\nIt said its investments in AI-surfaced content and Reels, a short video competitor with TikTok, were starting to pay off.\nThe progress were making on our AI discovery engine and Reels are major drivers of this, said Mark Zuckerberg, Metas CEO, in a company statement. Beyond this, our management theme for 2023 is the Year of Efficiency and were focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization.\nRevenue fell 4% to $32.17bn from $33.67bn. Analysts were expecting $31.55bn.\nAnalysts had predicted the company would see a big drop in its fourth-quarter net income compared with the previous year due to shrinking ad revenue and higher costs.\nWith the better-than-expected results, Metas shares jumped almost 18% in after-hours trading.\nDespite the positive outlook, Zuckerberg called for more belt-tightening in what signals another tough year ahead for the companys employees.\nIn response to its revenue drop and the inflationary market pressures, Meta laid off 11,000 workers in November. It also reshuffled its management team. Zuckerberg has hinted to employees that more layoffs and management cuts may lie ahead in 2023.\nStory continues\nMeta rode the digital wave created by the lockdown and now it is trying to avoid the wipe out,  wrote Tom Johnson, global chief digital dfficer at WPPs Mindshare Worldwide, just ahead of Metas earnings report Wednesday. The last six months have seen the company adjusting to ensure that it has a smooth passage out of the hyper growth period for digital advertising caused by lockdown and now it must battle with the tough economic environment that consumers find themselves in around the world.\nIts been a difficult year for Meta, which has faced heightened competition from TikTok, a tepid digital advertising market and questions over Mark Zuckerbergs decision to focus the company on creating a new metaverse  a bet which may take years to pay off if it ever does.\nAnd, in what some have criticised as an attempt to chase profits, Meta announced last week that it would allow Donald Trump to return to Facebook and Instagram soon, after banning him following the January 6 Capitol riots in 2021.\nRelated:"

Many think the women are the result of artificial intelligence.\nPart of the debate has some worried that the AI models are going to take over the adult content on OnlyFans.\nOne of the possibly AI created images features four blondes in dark lingerie.  The group is posing for a picture as one of them holds a phone.\nApparently this picture and other are going viral on socials because women are SEETHING and debating whether these girls are AI generated \nJanuary 27, 2023\nLaura Lux, an OnlyFans model originally from Australia, isnt one who is worried about a potential AI takeover.  Shes not worried because she doesnt think anything will be able to replace the real thing.\nBy real thing she means the connection she has to her following and their connection to her boobs.  She explained her lack of worry in a Twitter thread.\nLaura says that people arent subscribing to OnlyFans just to see random women naked.  Theyre subscribing to the persons OnlyFans because they want to see that person naked.\nOnlyFans model not worried about AI models (Image Credit: Laura Lux/Instagram)\nShe said\n, people do not subscribe to my OnlyFans because they want to see a random naked woman, they subscribe to my OnlyFans because they want to see ME naked.\nLaura points out that the most successful OnlyFans models brought their following with them to the platform from other social media platforms.  She knows this from firsthand experience.  The blonde beauty has millions of followers across multiple platforms.\nIts All About The Connection With Your Following, Laura Lux Knows This\nDuring the thread, Laura acknowledges that the connection with her following is a parasocial interaction.  After making that acknowledgement, she was accused by some of leading vulnerable men on.  She had different a thought on that claim and explained the parasocial interaction with her following.\nLaura said, seems a lot of people have misinterpreted my acknowledgment of a parasocial connection as deviously leading poor vulnerable men on rather than titty pics from someone youve followed on twitter for 7 years are more interesting than typing boobs into google image search.\nShe makes a strong argument.  Its true the top of the food chain models on these kinds of platforms dont have anything to worry about.  Laura certainly doesnt have anything to worry about.\nBut whos to say that the AI models wont be able to gain a large following on another platform then take that following to a subscription-based platform?  There are plenty of weird people out there.\nThat might make it a little more difficult for the next generation of OnlyFans models."
