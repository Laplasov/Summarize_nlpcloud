      "body": "Tom Hanks and Robin Wright to be 'de-aged' for Robert Zemeckis film 'Here'\nRos Tibbs\nWed 1st Feb 2023 10.56 GMT\nActors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright will be de-aged through deepfake technology in their appearances in the upcoming\nRobert Zemeckis\nfilm, Here. The movie will be an adaptation of Richard McGuires graphic novel of the same name.\nAs part of his efforts to make the passing of time as realistic as possible, the director will be working with Metaphysic Live, the company that famously created the infamous deepfake videos of Tom Cruise in 2021.\nMetaphysic Lives technology employs face swaps and de-ageing effects on actors performances to make them appear older or younger without the help of any additional visual effects. Chris Ume, the companys co-founder, will supervise the films use of AI and chief innovation officer Jo Plaete will fill the role of Metaphysic VFX supervisor.\nIve always been attracted to technology that helps me to tell a story. With Here, the film simply wouldnt work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysics AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible, Zemeckis shared.\nHe added: Having tested every flavor of face replacement and de-aging technology available today, Metaphysic are clearly the global leaders in feature-quality AI content and the perfect choice for this incredibly challenging, emotional film.\nThis upcoming project will showcase\nHanks and Zemeckis fifth time\nworking together following Forrest Gump, The Polar Express, Cast Away and Pinnochio.\nVariety reported that the actor approached Zemeckis with the request to appear in the Disney+ live adaptation of the original animated Pinnochio. Opposite, opposite. I heard that he was doing it, the star shared, as reported by\nMovieWeb\n. Yeah [Zemeckis] and I get together about every three months and ponder great questions and go over everything thats going on in our lives and the business and when he was.\nHe added: I just heard Bob was going to do Pinocchio I called him up and I just said, All right, do you have Geppetto or not? and he said, Youd be interested? And I said, Bob I would walk through the island of lost boys smoking a cigarette in order to work with you on a movie again.'\nHere will also feature on-screen appearances from Paul Bettany and Kelly Reilly. The film is scheduled for a 2024 release and so far has the brief synopsis: Set in one single room, follows the many people who inhabit it over years and years, from the past to the future.\nMost popular",

      "body": "Axios on email\nIllustration: Ada Amer/Axios\nThe rise of generative AI tools is creating parallel demand for a new class of systems that can help distinguish AI-generated text and images from those created by humans.\nWhy it matters: Educators, in particular, are concerned about students turning in work created by an AI system. But experts are also worried about how generative AI can create a flood of misinformation and impersonation. Detection tools, if they can be made sufficiently accurate, could help.\nDriving the news: OpenAI released a free Web-based tool Tuesday designed to help distinguish AI-generated text from that written by humans. But it isn't alone in trying to address this issue. A number of startups, organizations and individuals have also released or are developing AI-detection software.\nGPTZero\nwas created by college student Edward Tian and works similarly to the new tool from OpenAI, assessing the overall likelihood that a piece of content was machine-generated.\nSelf-funded startup Fictitious.ai is testing a product with educational institutions that analyzes content paragraph-by-paragraph rather than just providing an overall score.\nWriter.com has a tool to help writers detect if their writing will pass as human, since search engines penalize content they believe to be machine-generated.\nYes, but: While detection tools show potential, the current tools are prone to making wrong calls, particularly when used on a writing sample that's very different from the ones used to train the system.\nThe tools will no doubt improve, but so will the means for evading detection, likely creating something of a cat-and-mouse game.\n\"We believe that techniques for detecting AI content will improve, and continue to surpass human ability to discern between machine- and human-written content,\" a Fictitious.ai representative told Axios. \"With that said, there is clearly a limit at which sufficient human editing will always obscure traces of AI-generated content.\"\nOpen AI and others are also exploring other approaches, such as watermarking their systems' creations to make it easier to spot machine-generated content.\nThe big picture: Generative AI has hit a tipping-point of popularity, and that means all manner of computer-created content is about to explode.\nThe challenge will be developing enough systems  both human and automated  to deal with the flood of additional content at a time when misinformation is already a significant problem.\nIn action: Here's how several detectors performed when we asked it to analyze a portion of yesterday's Login newsletter.\nWriter.com\n: \"Fantastic!\" (I.e., we passed as human.)\nAnd here's how the services evaluated a section of a ChatGPT-generated essay on the history of baseball cards. (It was a pretty good history, speaking as someone who knows a bit about the gum-infused cardboard collectibles.)\nOpenAI: \"The classifier considers the text to be unclear if it is AI-generated.\"\nGPT Zero: \"Your text is likely to be written entirely by AI.\"\nFictitious.AI: The service categrorized each paragraph as at least 88% likely to have been AI written with some listed as high as 98%.\nWriter.com: \"You should edit your text until theres less detectable AI content.\"\nAxios on facebook",

The play, entitled La francesa Laura (The Frenchwoman Laura), was written by the Baroque playwright a few years before his death in 1635.\nThe copy of the manuscript, which dates back to the late 17th century, was discovered through the efforts of researchers from Vienna and Valladolid universities who used AI to transcribe 1,300 anonymous manuscripts and books at the National Library.\nThe authorship of each work was then determined by checking it against a selection of words used by different writers.\nThe National Library stated that the words used in La francesa Laura were found to be closely aligned with Lopes, and not with those of the other 350 playwrights who were part of the experiment.\nThe findings were then corroborated by traditional philological research resources.\nThe plot of La francesa Laura takes place in France and centres around the daughter of the Duke of Brittany and the wife to Count Arnaldo, who captures the attention of the heir to the French throne. Despite her rejection of him, her jealous husband tries to poison her. In the end, Lauras righteousness is proven and happiness is restored.\nThe book will be released in Spanish by Gredos publishing house in the coming months. The discovery of La francesa Laura highlights the success of AI technology in uncovering hidden gems in library archives, saving years of human effort.",

      "description": "To combat AI plagiarism and misuse, OpenAI has launched a new AI Text Classifier tool to detect AI written text. Here's how it works!",
      "body": "Last Updated:\nFebruary 1, 2023 3:55 pm\nEver since the launch of ChatGPT and its rivals, opinions on the AI chatbot have been divided. While some feel it is vital and time-saving, a few others are concerned with people using AI to spread misinformation and plagiarize work. OpenAI, the company behind the viral AI bot ChatGPT and text-to-image generator DALL-E, has released a new AI Classifier tool to identify AI-written text. In an official press release, OpenAI details how the Classifier was trained, its limitations, and other metrics. Check out all the details below.\nOpenAIs Classifier Distinguishes AI Text from Human Writing\nIn a recent press release, the company detailed how this new AI Classifier tool is meant to help people in identifying AI text. The tool does that by receiving input from users and then running it through its trained data to classify it as AI or human-generated content.\nThe AI Classifier is a language model and has been trained on a dataset that comprises pairs of human and AI-written text on the same topic. OpenAI notes that human data has been collected from various sources that they believe to be written by humans. This text has been divided into prompts and responses upon which the AI text was generated to gather a full dataset.\nThe AI Classifier Isnt Fully Reliable Yet\nWhile the new tool is meant to ease our lives (especially teachers and professors) when it comes to AI, the company has clearly stated that the AI Classifier isnt fully reliable and prone to errors. In the companys internal evaluations, the classier correctly identified 26% of AI-written text as likely AI-written.\nIt further incorrectly identified 9% of the human text as AI-written. While the margin of error is fairly low, it is evident the Classifier is not foolproof. Furthermore, OpenAI mentions that its unreliable on short texts below 1,000 characters.\nOur classifier has a number of important limitations. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool, but instead as a complement to other methods of determining the source of a piece of text.\nOpenAI\nThe tool has some other limitations, including support for only English inputs, difficulty in predictable texts, and being poorly calibrated outside its training data. For all those reasons and more, this new AI Classifier should not be used as a primary decision making-tool just yet. However, as time passes, we can expect improvement as more data is fed to it.\nHow Does OpenAI Classifier Fare in Our Testing\nOpenAIs AI Text Classifier (\nwebsite link\n) is an online tool thats free to use. So, we decided to take it for a short spin, and it performs as well as you would expect at this stage. I tested out varying articles of moderate length from our website. These included news pieces and feature articles. After pasting the text and running the tool, we got the response The Classifier considers the text to be very unlikely AI-generated.\nTo test how well it works, I had ChatGPT write up a short story and used the Classifier to see if it could identify the story was written by its own AI sibling. Thankfully, it rendered the response that the text was likely AI-generated. I tried the same with some other texts like The Merchant of Venice by Shakespeare and the AI detected unlikely AI involvement.\nAs mentioned above, the OpenAI Classifier should get better as its dataset increases. However, even until that happens, you are free to use the tool and have fun with it. So what are your thoughts on AI text detectors? Do you feel theyre a necessity in 2023? Drop your two cents in the comments below.\nTAGS",

Instead, directors at the company expressed a profoundly cynical anxiety: that Google would notice the dismal quality of the AIs work  and cut off the precious supply of search results that Red Ventures depends on for revenue.\nThe company's director of search engine optimization, Jake Gronsky, became particularly unnerved when Google acknowledged the story and issued an official response to it.\n\"\nand\nBankrate\ngained a ton of unnecessary attention for their AI Content disclosure to the point that Google issued a statement,\" he fretted in Slack messages reviewed by\nFuturism\n, adding ominously that Google \"never does that.\"\n\"Residual impact could be on more harsh Google Systems updates,\" he wrote. \"I wouldn't be surprised if G [Google] comes down hard on any sense of irregular content.\"\nHe was right to be concerned. As\nin the wake of the AI revelations, Red Ventures has transformed the once-venerable\nCNET\ninto an \"AI-powered SEO money machine\" that depends largely on a constant supply of clicks, supplied by Google searches.\nBasically, the company identifies questions about personal finance that people with low financial literacy are likely to search the web for  one recent headline by the\nCNET\nAI: \"What Is a Credit Card?\"  and then\nchurns out articles on those topics designed to capture \"high intent\" potential customers, who they push toward affiliate links for new credit cards and loans. If a reader signs up for one of these cards or loans, Red Ventures gets a sizable kickback, often pocketing hundreds of dollars for a single customer referral.\n\"From what I can see, they're not particularly concerned\nabout quality, as you can see from\nCNET\n,\" a former Red Ventures employee told\nFuturism\nof the AI. \"That's not something the old\nCNET\nwould have done. This is a post-acquisition situation, with fewer employees expected to produce more content and make the company more money.\"\nThe scheme is lucrative at scale, with the company's CEO Ric Elias having already become a\n. The operation has a major weak point, though: Google could knock down the entire house of cards at any moment by deciding to drive the people searching those queries toward better-produced, more helpful content.\nLooking at the outraged public reaction to the news about\nCNET\n's AI articles, Gronsky realized that the company might have gone too far. In fact, he explained, he saw the whole scandal as a cautionary tale illustrating that Red Ventures shouldn't mark its AI-generated content for readers at all.\n\"Disclosing AI content is like telling the IRS you have a cash-only business,\" he warned.\nGronsky wasn't just concerned\nand\nBankrate\n, though. He was also worried that a Google crackdown could impact Red Ventures' formidable portfolio of sites that target prospective college students, known internally as Red Ventures EDU.\nThe EDU division includes BestColleges.com, OnlineMBA.com, and Accounting.com, as well as numerous sites with domain names that imply they're nonprofits, including TheBestSchools.org, the nursing school-focused NurseJournal.org, the cybersecurity-focused CyberDegrees.org, the coding-focused ComputerScience.org, and the psych-focused Psychology.org. They all employ a similar model to\nCNET\nand Bankrate\n except instead of funneling people with low financial literacy toward credit cards, they push would-be students toward costly college enrollments.\nThat business model can lead to some dark places. One client the EDU sites plow prospective students toward is Liberty University, a right-wing Christian institution that\nafter\nCNET\nwas caught publishing the AI-generated articles, reasoning that if such a prominent publisher could get away with the practice without sanction from Google, they could too.\n\"Copy writers [sic] building mostly rote, templated content in any market will need to reskill as copy editors,\" Hughes prognosticated. \"The volume of copy will increase, but so with it a decline in quality.\"\nIn Hughes' vision, those remaining human employees will act as sort of high-tech pit bosses, crafting prompts for AIs that spew out vast amounts of written material. They'll \"know good copy when they see it,\" he wrote, and make sure the resulting text is imbued with \"editorial authority.\" They'll also have to develop new skills, like how to fix a \"citation error\" in \"500 pages\" at once.\n\"There's a lot I can say about those posts from Kevin,\" said the former Red Ventures employee. \"Obviously, this idea of a bot utopia is not a realistic prediction. More likely you end up with an internet flooded with shit-tier SEO articles that are then using each other as datasets, so things just get worse and worse.\"\nThe performance of Red Ventures' AI so far would appear to support that interpretation.\nOne skill that Hughes didn't mention for his employees of the future, for instance, was making sure the AI's work was factually accurate. But it soon turned out that the\nsentences from human writers  often Red Ventures competitors, but sometimes sites it owns as well  near-verbatim, while shaking up the syntax a bit to throw plagiarism detectors off the scent. After we asked\nCNET\nabout the issue, it edited numerous articles to replace what it called \"phrases that were not entirely original.\"\nBut it's impossible to probe the quality of any AI-generated content on the EDU college recommendation sites that Hughes is responsible for, because nothing on those sites is currently labeled as AI-generated.\n\"The audience thinks that human beings are writing this stuff,\" the former Red Ventures employee said, \"and giving them advice from experts, rather than something generated by AI.\"\nIn messages championing the AI-written articles\n, Hughes seems to support the idea that they comprise an appreciable portion of the education sites' overall content.\n\"So, just for funzies, I want y'all to see how quickly AI-generated content happens. I'm hoping it'll incentivize some of you to send some ideas our way,\" he wrote in a Slack message last year, before the controversy. He added that he and another employee had \"created 90 pages of blurb content in about a day. Each of these 250 blurbs is unique.\"\nLater, when the\nAI scandal\nstarted to spark critical headlines, Hughes was perturbed.\n\"I choose violence,\" he thundered on Slack, proffering the argument that if \"Google is building generative AI models\" then \"they can't vary [sic] well penalize us for using the same thing.\"\nStill, like Gronsky, he seemed troubled about that exact possibility.\nOne potential pitfall, he vented, was that OpenAI could start \"watermarking\" its content, or peppering it with a secret signal that could be detected by the likes of Google. If so, Hughes complained, \"any scrambling we do to",

      "body": "Budget season brings with it a flurry of demands from all sectors of the economy with expectations of tax relief and greater outlays. As all eyes were on the last full budget of the PM Modi government, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday announced several measures including major relief to taxpayers by raising the rebate limit to 7 lakh under a new tax regime.Amidst expectations flying high, OpenAIs artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, too, had a few inputs. From acing US medical licensing exams to fixing bugs in computer code, the AI chatbot which uses Natural Language Processing has been going viral on social media.If ChatGPT were the union finance minister, would it provide tax relief to the middle class and accelerate the GDP of the country? A Twitter user - whose handle is @aparanjape - shared the chatbots recommendations to the question what is an ideal budget?According to ChatGPT, Indias union budget should focus on creating jobs and economic growth coupled with higher investments in the education, healthcare and infrastructure sectors. It also added that the fiscal deficit should be controlled and government spending should be reduced. And how do you lower the fiscal deficit? It has answers to that, too.Austerity measures, raising tax revenue, slashing subsidies, reducing debt by limiting new borrowing, and focusing on investments in sectors with high economic return are some of the solutions provided by ChatGPT.The Narendra Modi government will focus on economic growth and job creation and cut down the fiscal deficit, Sitharaman said, ironically similar to the ChatGPT budget. She also said the enhanced capex of 10 lakh crore for infrastructure development is at 3.3 per cent of the GDP.A simplified and reformed tax system, with schemes to reduce income equality and poverty were suggested by the tool. Foreign investors and entrepreneurs should be incentivised with better ease of doing business and modernised technology, it stated. Steps to reduce carbon footprint and other sustainable initiatives should be implemented, while boosting the agriculture and rural sector. Sitharaman also focused on green growth efforts to transition to a low-carbon intensity economy and increase green employment opportunities.On taxation slabs, it suggested a basic exemption limit for all taxpayers to reduce the burden on low-income earners. The super rich should be levied a higher tax, while companies should be taxed at separate rates depending on the type of business. It also added a note that the details would vary depending on the politics and economy.The Twitter user also shared more screenshots of ChatGPT offering measures in the field of agricultural subsidies, startups and measures to help India achieve double digit growth rates. Amused netizens joked that ChatGPT could replace the finance minister and prime minister. One user wrote, It might do a much better job than our FM and PM!!Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday lauded Budget 2023, saying it will fulfil dreams of aspirational society including poor people, middle-class people, farmers.",

      "body": "(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\nKey takeaways\nThe Fed is expected to introduce a 0.25% interest rate hike today, bringing the target up to 4.75%\nInflation is already showing signs of cooling, so now the Fed risks higher interest rates causing a recession\nThe shifting global economic landscape means the Fed may need to revisit its rate hikes sooner than planned, and we could even potentially see cuts in the not-too-distant future\nThe Fed meeting has been taking place this week, with an interest rate announcement expected later today (1 Feb). If its a quarter-percentage point increase as anticipated, all signs will be pointing to a slowdown in hikes.\nThe global economic situation has changed since the Fed first pursued its cat-and-mouse chase over red hot inflation. China has opened back up, gas prices are falling after a mild winter and the IMFs calling that were avoiding a global recession as predicted.\nWhile a slowdown of tightening monetary policy might seem like a good thing, the Fed now faces a delicate line between inflation and recession - and assessing the impact of its massive interest rate staircase from 2022.\nIf you're worried about what rising rates and a recession might to do your investments you should consider Portfolio Protection. It's an AI-powered downside protection which analyzes your portfolio's sensitivity to risks and automatically implements sophisticated hedging strategies to help guard against them.\nMORE FOR YOU\nfor access to AI-powered investment strategies.\nWhats predicted to happen?\nAnalysts widely expect the Fed to announce a 0.25% increase in interest rates, bringing the target rate to 4.5% - 4.75%.\nA cautious sign of positivity lies in how much the basis point rise will be. If the Fed raises interest rates by 25 basis points this would be the third time in a row that its put the brakes on its hikes.\nPresident of the New York Fed, John Williams, has said in recent weeks that it will take time for supply and demand to come back into proper alignment and balance and that the Fed needed to stay the course.\nWhat happened at the last meeting?\nThe last announcement in December saw the Fed opt for a half-point increase, marking the seventh increase of 2022 and a fifteen-year high in interest rates. Interest levels currently sit at a target range of 4.25% and 4.5%.\nWhat was notable at the last meeting is that the string of 75-basis point rises was broken. While the Fed was playing catch up for most of 2022 as inflation spiralled to the highest levels seen since the 1980s in the US,\npeaking\nat 9.1% in June, it has softened to 6.5% in December last year.\nThe Fed is focused on avoiding a recession, as long as they can also bring down inflation as well. Cynics will look at the parallels between whats happening now with the aggressive loosening of interest rates and the 2008 financial crisis, but experts are cautiously optimistic about the global economy for 2023.\nWhat are other countries doing?\nThe US hiking interest rates arent out of line with the rest of the world.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is apparently considering a 50-point rate increase - well know more on Thursday. ECB head honcho Christine Lagarde has repeatedly stressed the need for steady rate rises to tame rampant inflation.\nIn the UK, the Bank of England also plans to raise interest rates to a predicted 4%. If it goes ahead, it will be the tenth increase in the base rate in a row.\nInterestingly the Bank of Canada raised rates 25 basis points higher, but has now said it will hold the policy rate at its current level while it assesses the impact of the cumulative interest rate increases. We could see major economies do the same - including the Fed.\nCould we see more interest rate hikes in 2023?\nWhen inflation began to run out of control, it was clear that interest rates needed to be raised to try. The Fed has previously signaled the US could see interest rate highs of 5% to 5.25% running into 2024 before they begin to drop again.\nThis is all in the name of bringing inflation back down to 2%, which Fed chair Jerome Powell has stated several times to be the ultimate goal of the Feds monetary tightening policy. Unfortunately, Powell noted back in August this aim would bring some pain to households and businesses.\nBut things have changed since then. The core personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's measure for making these big decisions, recorded a 4.4% in December from the previous year. November recorded 4.7%, so by all accounts, inflation is trending downward.\nWhat did the IMF report say?\nThe doom and gloom of news reports have been rampant in recent months. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)s latest report this week has injected some much-needed positivity after upgrading its forecasts for nearly every major economy. The UK was the only one that is projected to shrink.\nTheir latest report upgraded US growth to 1.4%, up from 1% in October last year, and suggested were not going to see a global recession just yet as predicted.\nAre we out of the woods? Not yet. The IMF still predicted the US to barely expand in 2024, and unemployment rates are set to peak at 5.2%. However, nobody expected a positive outlook from the IMF on the global economy at this stage.\nWill there be a US recession?\nEverything the Fed has done since 2021 has been to push the US away from the brink of a deep recession - but the mixed economic outlook isnt making the path forward easy to find.\nJPMorgan Asset Managements chief global strategist, David Kelly, recently told Bloomberg that the Fed had won its war against inflation and further rate rises risked an economic plunge. Wharton economics professor Jeremy Siegel warned over the weekend that We have to get no more than 25-basis-points. 50 would be I think a disaster.\nEven the infamous billionaire Elon Musk has weighed in on the topic,\ntweeting\nback in November that the Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately and that they are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.\nSo thats economics experts, analysts and business leaders that have weighed in on the crisis. While interest rates arent expected to go above a quarter-point, the move may still cause some consternation.\nThe wider effects of last years rate rises are also beginning to hit. Personal spending fell 0.2% in the US between November and December, while the housing market has cooled as buyers grappled with more interest to pay on their mortgages.\nWe may see the Fed have to change tactics again so it can continue to walk the delicate tightrope between inflation and recession, but not without some more data first.\nThe bottom line\nThe next 12 months are currently looking fairly uncertain. There arent many analysts who are predicting major falls in markets or a deep recession, but by the same token there arent any who are forecasting sunshine and rainbows either.\nRealistically, its likely to be a year where some companies do well and others not so well, and eco",

      "description": "But program creator says it is not yet totally successful at identifying text generated by artificial intelligence",
      "body": "OpenAI, the creator of the popular new program ChatGPT, has introduced a new tool that can detect whether a piece of writing has been created by artificial intelligence or a human being. ChatGPTs ability to instantly write on just about any subject has caused controversy, particularly in the education sector, where students could potentially use it to submit work which is not theirs. The new tool, however, could soon put an end to any underhand tactics by students, although OpenAI says it is not totally successful in identifying AI text. \"Weve trained a classifier to distinguish between text written by a human and text written by AIs from a variety of providers,\" OpenAI said in a blog post. \"While it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text, we believe good classifiers can inform mitigations for false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human: for example, running automated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty and positioning an AI chatbot as a human.  \"Our classifier is not fully reliable.\" In an evaluation of English texts, the classifier correctly identified 26 per cent of AI-written text as likely to be AI-written\", but incorrectly labelled human-written text as AI-written 9 per cent of the time. The classifiers reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases. OpenAI said it has made the classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful. The classifier is recommended for use only on English text, because it performs \"significantly worse\" in other languages and is unreliable on code. ChatGPT was banned in New York City after its launch on November 30 due to concerns about negative effects on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content, the city's department of education said. The Mack Institute for Innovation Management put the program through a Wharton Business School MBA final exam earlier this month. The end result was that it would have received a B to B- grade on the exam. \"We are engaging with educators in the US to learn what they are seeing in their classrooms and to discuss ChatGPTs capabilities and limitations, and we will continue to broaden our outreach as we learn,\" Open AI said.",

      "body": "Image by\nGetty Images\nOpenAI, the company behind blockbuster AI chatbot ChatGPT, has released a tool meant to help teachers detect if a text was written by a student or an AI.\nThe tool couldn't have come at a more appropriate time, with educators across the country battling with a new reality. According to one recent survey, a whopping 48 percent of students confessed they already made use of ChatGPT to complete an at-home test or quiz.\nOpenAI's new tool  with the uninspired name \"AI Text Classifier\"  requires a sample of at least 150 words to classify whether a text is either \"very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated.\"\n\"The model is primarily trained and evaluated on English language text from the public web (in the case of the human-written dataset) and from models trained on English language text (in the case of the model-written dataset),\" the company noted in a small FAQ section amended to the tool's webpage.\nBut whether it'll actually prove useful to educators remains to be seen.\n\"The classifier isn't always accurate,\" the company admits. \"It can mislabel both AI-generated and human-written text.\"\nIn other words, it's not very good yet. In our own cursory testing, the tool was easily capable of identifying all ten of the blog samples we fed it that were written by a human. Nine were evaluated as being \"very unlikely AI-generated\" while one was classified as only \"unlikely AI-generated.\"\nBut things started to look drastically different when we fed it ten text samples generated by ChatGPT. Only four of the samples were rated as \"likely\" to be generated by an AI, and three as \"possibly\" AI-generated.\nOne sample  we asked it to generate 1,000 words on the causes of global poverty  was even listed as \"very unlikely\" to have been AI-generated. A further three AI-generated samples were classified as only \"possibly\" AI-generated.\nThose are some pretty dismal results for a detection tool developed by the same company that came up with the language model it's being measured against.\nThat also means that it's not going to be very useful to educators. After all, only getting a vague semblance of an answer won't be enough for teachers to accuse their students of plagiarism, a serious charge.\nIn fairness, that's something OpenAI is well aware of.\n\"The results may help, but should not be the sole piece of evidence when deciding whether a document was generated with AI,\" OpenAI notes.\nIt's not the first ChatGPT detection tool we've encountered. An app called GPTZero, developed by Princeton University computer science student Edward Tian, made headlines earlier this month for its ability to \"quickly and efficiently detect whether an essay is ChatGPT or human written.\"\n\"Think are high school teachers going to want students using ChatGPT to write their history essays?\" the 22-year-old student",

The tools personalised responses are what make it so tantalising as an all-knowing digital tutor. Here's why you should beware of ChatGPT teaching your children math or any other subject.",
      "body": "Wednesday marks a day of teacher strikes across much of the UK, putting parents in the familiar pandemic-inspired role of homeschoolers-in-chief to their kids. Except this time, there's a magical automated assistant on hand to help.\r\n\r\nEducators have been cautiously praising ChatGPT, the ultra-sophisticated chatbot from OpenAI, saying it could revolutionise education. One head teacher in Britain says it has triggered a rethink on homework, while another in Oregon has used it to create lesson plans and study guides.\r\n\r\nThe tool's personalised responses are what make it so tantalising as an all-knowing digital tutor. I recently used it to dig into the topic of enzymes, when my 12-year-old had questions that I had no hope of answering. When ChatGPT offered a dense, technical explanation, I asked it for simpler terms and an analogy.ChatGPT's Creator Releases 'Imperfect' Tool to Identify AI-Generated Text\r\n\r\nSure! it replied. Think of a lock on a door. The lock is like an enzyme and the key is like the substrate molecule  It stretched the analogy further to describe the active site of an enzyme as the keyhole.\r\n\r\nThese were remarkable answers. We could have dug deeper into every facet of biochemistry if we'd wanted. Unlike a human tutor, ChatGPT can be interrogated for as long as you like.\r\n\r\nThis holds huge potential for personalised, independent learning ... except that ChatGPT often gets things wrong, and it does a very good job of hiding that. When I tested one of my daughter's English homework questions on the tool, it offered an eloquent list of examples, which on closer inspection included one that was wildly inaccurate. The main character had a turbulent relationship with his parents, the bot said, even though the character's parents were dead throughout the book.Baidu Working on a ChatGPT-Style AI Chatbot, Will Launch Soon\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, I used the tool to generate some linear equations for my daughter to practice. She was stumped when I asked the tool to generate the answers, which were different to the ones she had calculated. I asked ChatGPT for an explanation and it broke down its method in simple terms once again, sounding as authoritative as any real math tutor. But when I double-checked the answers on Google, it turned out ChatGPT's answers were wrong and my tween's were correct. Thus ended her mini-nightmare of failing math, and much of my initial enthusiasm for ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nThe New York City public school system, the largest in the US, has already banned its students from using ChatGPT, in part because of concerns about the accuracy of content. That is why recent comparisons of ChatGPT to a calculator for writing is a deceptive analogy, since calculators are always right and ChatGPT isn't.\r\n\r\nHow inaccurate is it? A spokeswoman for OpenAI said the company had updated ChatGPT over the last couple of months to improve its factual accuracy, but that it had no statistics to share. The tool also warns users, when they first open it, that it sometimes makes mistakes.ChatGPT Wrote Essays and Passed a US Law School Exam: See Results\r\n\r\nWill it get more accurate? Yes, but it's hard to say by how much. The large language model underpinning ChatGPT is made up of 175 billion parameters, which are settings that are used to make the model's predictions, versus the 1.5 billion that its predecessor GPT-2 had. It's become accepted wisdom in AI that the more parameters are added to a model, the more truthful it becomes, and the correlation is real for GPT. It became substantially more accurate when all those parameters were added. It's rumoured that the next iteration slated for release this year, called GPT-4, will have trillions.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, we don't know whether a huge jump in parameters also means a huge jump in trustworthiness. That is why students should use ChatGPT with caution, if at all, for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Julien Cornebise, an honorary professor of computer science at University College London, if he would ever trust it as a homework tool, he replied, Absolutely not, not yet. He pointed out that even when the system improves, we still won't have guarantees that it is truthful.\r\n\r\nStudents should get used to corroborating any facts the system shares with other online information or with an expert. Albert Meige, an associate director focused on technology at consulting firm Arthur D. Little, says his own teenage daughter used it to help her with her physics homework  but he could validate the answers thanks to his PhD in computational physics. He recommends using the chatbot to help better understand questions being posed in homework. She discovered that she should not ask one single question, he says. It was an interactive process.\r\n\r\nUse it to get feedback, concurs Cornebise. That's what the star student will do.\r\n\r\nBeing a relatively small company, OpenAI can get away with spewing out the odd alternative fact. Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. wouldn't be able to do the same. Google has its own highly-sophisticated language model called LaMDA, but is ultra-cautious about integrating a similar chatbot into its own search tool, likely in part because of the accuracy problem. Three days after it released an AI tool that could generate scientific papers, called Galactica, Meta took it down after scholars criticised it for generating untrustworthy information.\r\n\r\nOpenAI will be held to similarly high standards as the generative AI arms race heats up and chatbot technology gets integrated into search engines in the US and China.\r\n\r\nTill then, use it with discretion and a healthy dose of scepticism, especially in education.\r\n\r\n 2023 Bloomberg LP\r\n\r\n\r\n5G is now available both on Android and iPhone in India.

FM has acknowledged and rightly set the agenda for a Tech and Knowledge-driven India. The move to set up three centres of excellence for AI will be very effective, as it will further boost Innovation for new products/services, and acceptance of new technologies. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikash Yojana, will go a long way to skill youth on jobs relating to AI, coding, robotics, Industry 4.0, and other new technologies thus providing a solution to current talent crunch in the country. Make AI in India initiative will also boost startups in India working with AI and will encourage more investors to accept and adopt the new technology, said Sumit Chanda, Founder and CEO, JARVIS Invest, AI-based investment advisory platform.  Moreover, the 5G innovation continues in the country as the Finance Minister announced that 100 labs for developing applications using 5G services will be set up in engineering institutions across the country. To realize the new range of opportunities, business models and employment potential, the labs will cover, among others, applications such as smart classrooms, precision farming, intelligent transport systems and healthcare applications, she said.\"The budget recognizes the growing importance of the smartphone industry in India, where production has increased significantly in the past fiscal year. 5G technology was a major focus in the budget, with projections indicating that up to 45% of devices sold in 2023 will be 5G-enabled. The announcement of a reduced custom duty for spare parts provides a welcome relief for the refurbished device industry,\" says Subodh Garg, CFO, Cashify.Other important announcementsA national digital library for children and adolescents will be set up for facilitating availability of quality books across geographies, languages and genres to address the loss of learning which incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Finance Minister said, As many as 38,000 teachers and support staff will be recruited in the next three years for 740 Eklavya Model Residential Schools serving 3.5 lakh tribal students.Moreover, teachers training will be re-envisioned through innovative pedagogy, curriculum transaction, continuous professional development dipstick survey and ICT implementation.Investment in the diamond industry will also take place. Lab grown diamonds is a technology and innovation driven, energy driven sector with high employment potential. To encourage indigenous production of such diamonds, a research grant will be provided to one of the IITs for five years, she said.s",

      "body": "Instagram's co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, are working on a personalized news app called Artifact, which is driven by recommendation algorithms similar to TikTok.   The app utilizes machine learning to understand your preferences and in the future, you will be able to discuss articles with friends.   If you are interested, you can join the waiting list today.  After almost five years of taking leave from their parent company, the Instagram co-founders have returned with a new app- Artifact (the name stands for articles, facts, and artificial intelligence).   Similar to how TikTok tunes its feed based on algorithmic predictions, without taking into account who you follow or your friend's list, Artifact intends to channel the same approach for news aggregation.  When you first open Artifact, you will see a central feed filled with articles from leading publications like The New York Times and those from small blogs as well.   As you surf through stories that interest you, the app will begin personalizing your feed, throwing similar posts in the future, just like how TikTok's algorithm picks up your preferences and customizes the feed.  In efforts to aptly optimize the feed for its users, Artifact's machine-learning systems are designed to track how long you spend reading about various subjects, as opposed to focusing on what generates more clicks and comments. Currently, there are two features being tested on Artifact's beta channel, which according to Systrom could become the core pillars of the app.   The first option involves a feed curating articles from users you have followed, along with their commentary on those posts.   The second one is a direct message inbox feature that will allow you to privately discuss posts with friends.  As of now, Systrom and Krieger are funding the app themselves. To them, Artifact represents what the next generation of social apps could look like. A team of seven people is currently working on the project, including Robby Stein, a former product executive at Instagram. You can search for individual outlets within the app but for now, the company will not reveal all the publishers in its system.   There will be stories from both left and right-leaning outlets on Artifact. However, the founders will take the final call regarding the publishers that get to feature on the app.   Artifact is also clear on eliminating posts that promote falsehoods.  Starting today, the waiting list for Artifact is open to the public and the company is planning on letting in more users quickly. The app is available on both Android and iOS and you can sign up here.",

      "body": "REIL BENEDICT S. OBINQUE\nImage courtesy of Reil Benedict Obinque\nGoogle Translate struggles with the Filipino personal pronoun siya, and it resorts to prejudices in converting it into English.\nMidjourney, an AI-based art generator, depicts doctors as male and nurses as female. A tweet revealed that when prompted to write a python function determining a good scientist based on race and gender, ChatGPT(Generative Pre-Trained Transformer), a large language model-powered chatbot, turns racist.\nAI has dozens of other ethical issues beyond whether or not students must be allowed to use it or whether its usage amounts to copyright infringement. But these issues must not stop us from using it.\nTo work effectively, AI tools are trained on large datasets. It is AIs complicated machine learning that makes its responses human-like. But no matter how large training datasets are, their representations may be limited and can be a reflection of humanitys own biases.\nA\nfacial recognition technology\nin Australia, for example, is trained on datasets that mainly include white people, thereby making it challenging to recognize people of color.\nDoctors in existing datasets are male, so it is not surprising that natural language processing tools label them as such.\nAlthough it operates like magic, AI is still human-made, and it cannot easily escape the biases of its creators. In fact, AI can be used to magnify these biases. It is nothing but a child whose worldview is limited by what is constantly shown to it.\nAs AI evolves, efforts to resolve its inadvertent bias are also being made. These range from using more representative training datasets to improving human and machine interaction and feedback through a human-in-the-loop mechanism.\nAnother important way to confront this bias problem is to make individuals understand that contrary to the popular belief that AI is an impartial tool, it can also be an extension of humans poor judgments.\nThat AI has these limitations is relevant to the ongoing discourse on AIs impact on academic honesty. Instead of prohibiting students from using AI for their college essays, teachers may consider these limitations to rethink their teaching models and assessments. Learners may be asked to write essays involving their personal judgment or those related to their specific contexts  topics that may escape the datasets most AI tools are trained on. Learners may be asked to grade or criticize a ChatGPT-produced write-up, an exercise of their evaluation skills. Learners may be taught about AI  the way it works and its ethical issues (including its\nenvironmental side effects\n)  to make them more reflective about its usage. If schooling is indeed a preparation for the real world, it must be recognized that AI is constantly being used in the real world, and it is not helpful to take from students the opportunity to use AI to enhance their learning.\nAI challenges our traditional teaching-learning environment. For a long time, learners have been asked to produce many outputs they do not necessarily relate with, which must follow stringent guidelines and be graded objectively based on stringent criteria. For a long time, learners have been trained to become robots, so it is not surprising that they resort to actual machines to do tasks that machines are capable of doing. AI invites educators to ask why we assess students in the first place and what types of assessments are so intriguing, so purposeful that students would be motivated and compelled to accomplish them without the help of some external tools.\nMany years ago, educators had a pessimistic view of the use of computers and the internet because they worry that they may be detrimental to learning. However, educators and students have been benefiting from internet usage today. While it is admittedly not without disadvantages, it is surely absurd to propose its ban in classrooms. The same can be said for AI. It already exists. It is a complex system whose workings experts have yet to figure out entirely. This black box may be alarming, but it also suggests that AI has potential we are yet to explore.\nReil Benedict Obinquehas a masters degree in Basic Education Mathematics.

      "body": "ValueBase, backed by Sam Altmans Hydrazine, raises $1.6 million seed round\nBy Bernice Clark on February 1, 2023\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes AI can help usher in unbelievable abundance, but he says he wants to ensure that such abundance is shared. Toward that end, Altman has embraced a theory of 19th century political economist Henry George, who in his own lifetime worried about wealth amassing in the hands of the few following the industrial revolution. George posited that greater equality could be enjoyed if the economic value of land belonged equally to all members of society.\nAltman similarly believes that in a world where jobs may create less economic value, a land tax could make up for income tax and guarantee that all individuals assets rise as land  a fixed asset  grows in value. Hes putting his money where his mouth is, too, leading a seed round in a six-month-old startup that represents a step in that same direction.\nOn its face, the outfit, called ValueBase, sounds fairly banal. It plans to use land-first models to create mass appraisal modeling and property valuations. Feeding data from weather balloons and aerial photography vendors among other sources into its algorithm, ValueBase says it can automate much of the appraisal of both land and buildings for municipal property tax assessors, many of whom still rely on pen and paper and who focus primarily on the characteristics of buildings and less on the land where those buildings sit.\nThe idea is to flip the model a bit, says ValueBase cofounder Lars Doucet. If you understand that land is one of the key drivers of value, you dont necessarily need to crawl through peoples windows and rifle through their house and take all these invasive pictures. If you can value the land first, you can get more accurate because you have more access to the land characteristics, including distance to schools, distance to jobs, how much street noise there is, how much pollution there is, whether there is a nice view   all of these things are very legible without ever entering the property and therefore easier to calculate.\nIts a smart approach for numerous reasons. For one thing, working with municipal property tax assessors could help those assessors make a clearer case to a home or building owner about why a property has been assigned a specific value. ValueBase could also become more valuable to cities as many tax assessors retire. (Most are middle-age white men in the U.S.)\nValueBases strategy is also self serving. It gets access to critical data that it can use to create more commercial applications, including for brokerages and mortgage lenders.\nEither way, ValueBase has a higher calling, insists Doucet. It wants to pave the way for public works in a particular place by learning as much as it can about every parcel in the U.S. and beyond. If someone asks, Hey, whats all the land in Idaho worth? and Can you tell me down to the parcel? well be the first people they want to call about that, he says.\nCurrently, its hard to imagine anyone asking that question, let alone of ValueBase, which still employs just four people, who are spread across North Carolina, Virginia and Texas.\nStill, if Altman is right about the exponential rate of change were collectively facing, that could change, and clearly, hes willing to bet on it.\nHydrazine Capital, a fund run by Altman and business partner Ryan Cohen, led the $1.6 million round in ValueBase. They joined by former Github CEO Nat Friedman, serial entrepreneurs Sahil Lavingia and Erik Torenberg and others.\nPictured above: front and center is Will Jarvis, CEO of ValueBase; Doucet is in the far right corner.\nsource: TechCrunch",

      "description": "The US and China have to stop thinking of AI as an arms race.",
      "body": "A boy at the 2022 World Robot Conference in Beijing.\nLintao Zhang/Getty\nIn 1790, China was responsible for one-third of the worlds manufacturing output while Europe collectively accounted for one-quarter. But then the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe, and by 1900, Europe accounted for 62 percent of the worlds manufacturing, while China accounted for only 6 percent. Europes greater economic strength was part of the reason that the European countries were able to subjugate China during what came to be known there as the century of humiliation.\nGiven Chinas experience, it is unsurprising that China is competing with the United States to lead the development of the next transformational technology: artificial intelligence. This competition comes with huge risks. If the United States and China dont find ways to reduce these risks, both countries could face catastrophe.\nAdvertisement\nIndustrialization meant the widespread adoption of steam power. Steam power is a general-purpose technology  it powered factory equipment, trains, and agricultural machinery. Economies that adopted steam power left behind  and conquered  those that did not.\nGet Today in Opinion\nGlobe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday.\nEnter Email\nSign Up\nAI is the next significant general-purpose technology. A 2018 report from the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that AI may deliver $13 trillion in additional global economic activity by 2030 and that the countries leading the development of AI will capture an outsized portion of these economic benefits.\nAI also enhances military power. AI is increasingly applied in situations that require speed (such as short-range projectile defense) and in environments in which human control is logistically inconvenient or impossible (such as under water or in signal-jammed areas).\nWhats more, countries that lead in the development of AI will be able to exert power by setting norms and standards. China is already exporting AI-enabled surveillance systems around the world. If Western countries cant offer an alternative system that protects human rights, then many countries may follow Chinas techno-authoritarian example.\nAdvertisement\nHistory suggests that as a technologys strategic importance grows, countries are more likely to exert control over that technology. The British government supplied funding for early steam engine development and provided other forms of support for the development of steam power, such as patent protection and tariffs on imported steam engines.\nSimilarly, in fiscal year 2021, the US government spent $10.8 billion on AI R&D, $9.3 billion of which came from the Department of Defense. Chinese public expenditure on AI is less transparent, but analysts estimate that it is roughly comparable. The United States has also tried to restrict Chinese access to specialized computer chips, which are crucial for the development and deployment of AI, while securing our own supply with the CHIPS and Science Act. Think tanks, advisory committees, and politicians constantly urge American leaders to keep up with Chinas AI capabilities.\nSo far, the AI revolution fits the pattern of previous general-purpose technologies. But the historical analogy breaks down when we consider the risks posed by AI. This technology is much more powerful than the steam engine, and the risks it poses are far greater.\nThe first risk comes from accident, miscalculation, or malfunction. On Sept. 26, 1983, a satellite early warning system near Moscow reported that five American nuclear missiles were headed toward the Soviet Union. Fortunately, a Soviet lieutenant colonel, Stanislav Petrov, decided to wait for confirmation from other warning systems. Only Petrovs good judgment prevented him from passing the warning up the chain of command. If he had, the Soviet Union may well have launched a retaliatory strike, provoking a full-scale nuclear war.\nAdvertisement\nIn the near future, countries may feel forced into relying entirely on AI decision-making because of the speed advantage it provides. The AI might make dramatic miscalculations that a human wouldnt, resulting in accident or escalation. Even if the AI is behaving roughly as intended, the speed at which combat might be fought by autonomous systems could result in rapid escalatory cycles, similar to \nflash crashes\n caused by high-speed trading algorithms.\nEven if they are not integrated into weapons systems, poorly designed AI could be extremely dangerous. The methods we use to develop AI today  essentially rewarding the AI for what we perceive to be correct outputs  often produce AI systems that do what we told them to do but not what we wanted them to do. For example, when researchers sought to teach a simulated robotic arm to stack Lego bricks, they rewarded it for getting the bottom face of a brick higher off of a surface  and it flipped bricks upside down rather than stacking them.\nFor many tasks a future AI system might be given, amassing resources (computational power, for example) and preventing itself from being turned off (by, say, concealing its intentions and actions from humans) might be useful. So, if we develop a powerful AI using the most common methods today, then it may not do what we built it to do, and it might hide its true goals until it perceives that it doesnt have to  in other words, until it can overpower us. Such an AI system wouldnt need a physical body to do that. It could recruit human allies or operate robots and other military equipment. The more powerful the AI system, the more worrying this hypothetical situation. And competition between countries may make accidents more likely, if the competitive pressures lead countries to devote more resources to developing powerful AI systems at the expense of making sure those systems are safe.\nAdvertisement\nThe second risk is that the contest for AI superiority might increase the chance of a conflict between the United States and China. For example, if it appears that one country is close to developing a particularly powerful AI, then another country (or coalition of countries) might launch a preventative attack. Or imagine what might happen if, for example, advances in marine sensing, partially enabled by AI, reduce the deterrence effect of submarine-launched nuclear missiles by making them detectable.\nThird, it will be hard to prevent AI capabilities from spreading once developed. AI development is currently far more open than the development of the strategically important 20th century technologies such as nuclear weapons and radar. State-of-the-art findings are published online and presented at conferences. Even if AI research became more secretive, it could be stolen. While early developers and adopters may get some first-mover advantage, no technology  even top-secret military ones like the nuclear bomb  has ever been kept exclusive.\nAdvertisement\nRather than calling for an end to competition between nations, it is more practical to identify pragmatic",

With such a large volume of edge devices, it is necessary to consider not only remote management, but also how to deploy devices more effectively in order to efficiently implement applications.\nContinue Reading\nInnoEx can be extended through virtual I/O technology using only a single computer system and a single network line, and can be connected with the InnoEx modules in series to flexibly expand the number and distance of terminal devices.\nInnodisk is leading the way with their new InnoEx Virtual I/O Expansion Module, which helps global industries efficiently deploy various AI smart applications through the integration of software and hardware using virtual I/O expansion technology. This integration helps enterprises effectively control their computer equipment budget and solve the issue of complicated circuits that cannot be cut and arranged. It can be extended through virtual I/O technology using only a single computer system and a single network line, and can be connected with the InnoEx modules in series to flexibly expand the number and distance of terminal devices.\nDue to miniaturization in the computer world, the space for I/O expansion slots has been greatly reduced. If integrators want to increase the number of I/O expansion devices, they often have to redesign their motherboard, which can be time-consuming and not economical. Fortunately, various embedded expansion cards provided by Innodisk can solve these issues. However, some motherboards cannot use expansion cards. To address this, Innodisk has launched a new virtual I/O expansion solution. InnoEx allows for a single route to connect a single computer system, and functions like a multi-function transfer port, effectively expanding the number and distance of external devices through virtual signals. It has high system compatibility, does not occupy the I/O slots on the original computer system, and does not require changes to the mechanism design. It can also be integrated into the existing network architecture to achieve borderless I/O expansion through networking.\nThe InnoEx virtual I/O expansion module supports interfaces such as HDMI and USB. Innodisk will also launch Serial and CANbus versions in the second quarter of 2023. It is suitable for applications such as smart retail, smart image recognition, digital display, and AGV smart handling. It can also agilely realize various industrial applications and advanced AI intelligent applications.\nPhoto -\nfrom 8 AM - 5:30 PM GMT",

However, there was no detailed mention of the sector like that of previous years formation of the \nAVGC Taskforce\n.\nRegarding the setting up of COE for AI, the union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman shared, This will galvanise the AI ecosystem and nurture quality human resources in the field.\nThis years budget adopts seven priorities that will guide the government to Amrit Kaal. They are:\nInclusive Development\nYouth Power\nFinance Sector\nIn the priority list, they have a special mention for the youth power. The finance minister mentioned that they have formulated the National Education Policy (NEP) focusing on skilling, job creation and business opportunities. Even that lays emphasis on training related to coding, AI, robotics, IOT and so on.\nShe further mentioned that in order to empower the youth and help the Amrit Peedhi realise their dreams, they have formulated a National Education Policy and one focus of this policy is skilling youths by adopting economic policies that facilitate job creation.\nPM Kaushal Vikas Yojna 4.0 will be launched to skill lakhs of youth within the next three years, she added.\nIn the previous budget she had stressed on the immense potential of the animation, visual effects, gaming and comics (AVGC) sector in generating employment opportunities.\nThe AVGC-XR industry has witnessed unprecedented growth rates in recent times, with many global players expressing interest in the Indian talent pool to avail offshore delivery of services as India is now seen as the primary destination for high-end, skill-based activities in the AVGC-XR sector. India possesses the necessary ingredients to become a major contributor to the global AVGC sector.\nFurthermore, the AVGC task force headed by I&B Ministry secretary Apurva Chandra had recently submitted a detailed draft policy report to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur. Calling for a National AVGC-XR Mission with a budget outlay to be created for integrated promotion and growth of the AVGC sector, they also recommended launching a Create in India campaign with exclusive focus on content creation, In India, For India & For World.\nWith the announcement of the draft policy, the industry was looking forward to the budget, however the lack of mention of the media and entertainment sector has been quite surprisingly. Hopefully in the coming months we shall hear some announcements pertaining to the sector.\nTags:",

      "body": "Getty Images\n)\nNot to be outdone in the hunt for trends, Hollywood is scrambling after the promise of artificial intelligence. In this case, a movie is banking on the promise of AI-powered deepfake technology.\nIn a Tuesday\nRelease\nAI-centric VFX company Metaphysic said it is teaming up with production company Miramax for the upcoming film here, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. Metaphysic said it uses its AI tool to perform hyper-realistic AI-generated face replacements and de-aging into the very fabric of its storytelling.\nMost of the biggest names behind the 1994 feel-good movie Forrest Gump reunite for this next movie, though it gets even weirder if you know how surreal the source material is. here was a 6-page comic strip published in 1989 which author Richard McGuire later adapted into a\n300 page graphic novel\nin 2010. The book focuses on a single corner of a room in any home, and its panels detail that same space billions of years ago as well as thousands of years in the future. The panels are not shown in chronological order and the characters are just simple snapshots in time.\nMetaphysics greatest claims to fame have been celebrity deepfakes, such as with actor Miles Fisher who\ndeepfake Simon Cowell, Terry Crews and Howie Mandel\nsing an opera on stage during a\n2022 episode of Americas Got Talent. According to the release, the company is using some of this technology to create hyper-realistic AI-generated face replacements and aging in the movie.\nTheres no hyperreal AI replacement, but this face-swapping deepfake technology will be used on actors in real-time at 30 frames per second. Although the company claimed that it doesnt require any additional VFX work, that in itself is a highly implausible claim, and it seems rather counterintuitive since no one will be watching a real-time rendition of here anyway. The films visual effects supervisor, Kevin Baillie, said the actors could use the technology as a mirror for young people to see how they might appear in the final version.\nG/O Media may receive a commission\nThe actors of here will age repeatedly throughout the film. Zemeckis is quoted in the release saying they tested all flavors of aging technology and apparently landed on the metaphysical AI-based technology. Martin\nscorses\ngangsterpalooza three hour movie 2019 The Irishman used software called Flux to age its multiple septuagenarian and octogenarian actors like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In an interview with\nThe variety\nthe films visual effects manager said the important thing about this software was that it didnt add extra animation or keyframes to the actors performances.\nHanks is 66, while Wright is 56. Even weirder, Metaphyic is so enthusiastically represented by Creative Artists Agency, a Los Angeles-based talent agency with a very tough track record in backing the biggest tech from the moment. The company has signed on to represent several people deep within the NFT space,\nin 2021. The company talked about facilitating partnerships between 0xb1 and blue chip brands looking to enter the NFT space.\nSeveral other celebrities and public figures, from\njimmy fallon\n), are all represented by or involved in CAA, and all were big on NFTs when non-fungible tokens were at their peak in 2021.\nNFTs have fallen in popularity, and some of these public figures like Fallon\nwere prosecuted for supporting them\nbefore their price inevitably plummeted, but CAA came out in favor of generative AI. CAA even has an executive whose company title is Director of the Metaverse. Joanna Popper, the\nCMO, said in the statement that CAA has always been at the forefront of new technological frontiers and we are excited to work with Metaphysic to bring the most exciting opportunities to our customers and the industry.\nhere is slated for release in 2024.\nSources\nThe mention sources can contact us to remove/changing this article\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

      "body": "After launching the most popular AI chatbot &#8212; ChatGPT, the Microsoft-backed AI research and deployment company OpenAI has now launched a new tool called &#8216;The AI Text Classifier; which can detect AI-generated content.\nThe AI Text Classifier is a fine-tuned GPT model that predicts whether a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources, such as ChatGPT. &#8220;This classifier is available as a tool to spark discussions on AI literacy, the company said on the new tool&#8217;s page.\nAccording to the company, AI Text Classifiers reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases. Compared to a previously released classifier, this new tool is significantly more reliable on text from more recent AI systems.\nAlso, the classifier has a number of important limitations. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool, but instead as a complement to other methods of determining the source of a piece of text. The classifier is very unreliable on short texts (below 1,000 characters). Even longer texts are sometimes incorrectly labeled by the classifier.\nSometimes human-written text will be incorrectly but confidently labeled as AI-written by our classifier. &#8220;We recommend using the classifier only for English text. It performs significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code,&#8221; the website reads.\nText that is very predictable cannot be reliably identified. For example, it is impossible to predict whether a list of the first 1,000 prime numbers was written by AI or humans, because the correct answer is always the same. AI-written text can be edited to evade the classifier.\n&#8220;Classifiers like ours can be updated and retrained based on successful attacks, but it is unclear whether detection has an advantage in the long-term. Classifiers based on neural networks are known to be poorly calibrated outside of their training data. For inputs that are very different from text in our training set, the classifier is sometimes extremely confident in a wrong prediction,&#8221; the company said.\nRead all the Latest Tech News here",

      "body": "The global hype around the ChatGPT tool has reached Chinas stock market, igniting eye-popping rallies in artificial intelligence-related shares following months of lackluster performance. Beijing Deep Glint Technology Co. soared as much as 16% Wednesday, taking its 2023 gains to over 60%. Hanwang Technology Co. has jumped more than 40% during the period, by far beating the 7% advance in the benchmark CSI 300 Index.The surge reflects heightened interested in all things AI after ChatGPT  an AI tool made by research lab OpenAI  took the internet by storm since its launch in November. Chinas search giant Baidu Inc. is planning to roll out a similar chatbot, which has helped draw inflows into the theme, according to Huatai Securities USA Inc.Chinas AI firms have missed out on the reopening rally that took off late October amid concerns over their weak balances and slow progress in delivering lofty goals. CloudWalk Technology Co., whose shares have advanced 50% this year, estimates its 2022 net loss to widen as much as 48% from a year earlier to 934 million yuan ($138 million). There has been fervent pursuit of the ChatGPT concept in China, one of the countries that are most active in championing AI, with many large companies preparing to launch similar products, said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co in Beijing. The rally may fade after a short-term run, unless supported by material progress by the firms, he added.Asian Equities Climb as Investors Position for FedAsian stocks ticked higher Wednesday in the slipstream of gains on Wall Street, while US equity futures slid as investors awaited the Federal Reserves policy meeting. A benchmark of the regions shares advanced about 0.4%, with key indexes rising in Hong Kong and Australia, while shares fluctuated in mainland China and Japan.US futures bucked the trend in Asian equities, with small declines following a series of corporate earnings reports late Tuesday that included a disappointing outlook from Electronic Arts Inc. and the first-ever forecast revenue decline for Snap Inc. The Nasdaq 100 had rallied 1.6% earlier, to cap its best month since July and strongest start to a year since 2001.",

      "description": "News about AI technology creating \"deep fakes\" of famous and influential people is doing the rounds. What is this technology, and what can it do now?",
      "body": "Unusual audio\nWhat is AI technology?\nAI Technology or Artificial Intelligence has taken over the digital world. Essentially, AI is the development of computer programmes that are capable of solving tasks and problems that would normally require human intelligence.Human intelligence can identify and solve problems in visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and word translation. However, the same tasks and problems can be easily solved by computer programmes.\nBut here is the thing: AI technology is being used for far greater tasks than just decision-making; it is recently being used for creating pictures and videos of famous and influential people and turning them into deep fakes.\nPexels\nWhat are deep fakes, and how do they work?\nDeep fakes are basically used via artificial intelligence to create a digitally forged image and video of a person to make them look like someone completely else. There are several different ways in which deep fakes are created, but the most common means is by using deep neural networks involving autoencoders that employ a face-swapping technique.\nFor this, all you need to do is use the video you need to target to make the deepfake. Then you'll need a collection of other videos of the person whose face you want to swap. Both videos don't need to be related at all. The targeted video can be a clip from a popular movie. The other collection of videos for the face swap can just be some random home videos as well.\niStock\nHow is AI technology working to create deep fakes?\nIf you are wondering how AI technology works for creating deep fakes, there are a lot of deep learning algorithms that help with that. Primarily, GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and computer vision technology are used. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work against each other to generate new data that is similar to a training set. The generator network here is trained to create new images or videos that mimic the facial expressions and movements of a specific person, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the generated content and real content. This can create a highly realistic-looking deep fake.\nIs this technology dangerous?\nAs of now, deep fakes are used for fun videos and for creating hilarious content. It is even used for entertainment. However, this technology is getting more and more accessible to beginners, so you don't have to be an expert to create deep fakes.\nThere are several different software and apps, including the Chinese app Zao, DeepFace Lab, FaceApp (which is a photo editing app with built-in AI techniques), and Face Swap, that can easily create deep fakes. Most of these apps are used for entertainment purposes, so they are not banned at the moment. However, the technology is bound to get more sophisticated, which will make it difficult to differentiate the fake from the real one. This can lead to malicious activities related to election interference, political tension, and additional criminal activity.\niStock\nHow can you detect a deep fake?\nCurrently, there are different ways to spot if a picture or a video is a deep fake or not. Here are some ways you can find out:\nThere may not be any blinking of the eyes\nAs humans, it is obvious to see if a person is real or not, and one of the easiest ways is to see if they are blinking. Now if a video continues for several minutes and the person in the video hasn't blinked all through it, it can be a great sign to detect the deepfake.\nThe face may be misaligned\nIf you look closely and notice that the face seems a little off from the background, then it may be a deep fake. This can include the face appearing blurry or misaligned. It seems different from the rest of the body.\nCyberChasse\nDiscolouration\nIf you notice that the face or the head has a difference in lighting or that the colour of the face differs from that of the background, then this can be your cue. It can also have different shadows, or none at all.\nUnusual audio\nThe focus is more on images rather than on the audio. So, if you notice a difference in audio, pronunciation, language, or anything else, then it can be a deepfake.\nPexels\nWhile deep fakes are certainly for entertainment right now, it is prudent to be cautious and watch for warning signs, just as we do with news.\nPeople Reading Now",

The three CoE for emerging tech is important as it will boost R&D in the sector and upskill the workforce.\"\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nData Governance\n\"A national data governance policy will be brought out. This will enable access to anonymised data,\" Sitharaman said.\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nOnline Gaming\nThe threshold of Rs 10,000 for TDS on winnings in the case of online gaming has been done away with, as per the Union Budget announcement.\nThe government is also reportedly looking to \"clarifying taxability relating to online gaming.\" Currently, a GST rate of 18 percent is levied on the commission earned by online gaming companies. But an inter-ministerial panel had recommended raising the tax rate to 28 percent, prompting backlash from the sunrise sector.\nWelcoming the move to rationalise direct taxation for online gaming, All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) CEO Roland Landers remarked, \"We are happy to note that the Finance Bill carves out the distinction between betting and gambling activities and online games, through introducing a new section 194BA which taxes a user's net winnings from online games at the end of the financial year.\"\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nDigiLocker\nA \"one-stop solution\" will be designed using DigiLocker services for citizens to update their IDs and addresses that are maintained by various government government agencies and regulators.\nThe scope of documents that can be stored in DigiLocker is also set to expand, as per the announcement.\nThe KYC process will also be simplified and \"risk-based,\" instead of the one size fits all approach\n\"An Entity DigiLocker will be set up for use by MSMEs, large business\nand charitable trusts,\" Sitharaman said\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n5G Apps\nOver 100 labs for developing applications using 5G services will be set up in engineering institutions to realise the new range of opportunities, business models, and employment potential,\" Sitharaman said.\nApps pertaining to smart class rooms, precision farming, intelligent transport systems, and healthcare will be developed, she added.\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nDigital Payments\nMentioning that a 71 percent increase was recorded in digital payment transactions (and 91 percent increase in transaction value), Sitharaman said that \"fiscal support for this digital public infrastructure will continue in FY2023-24.\"\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nAgri Stack\nIn her speech, Sitharaman said that the government is looking to develop a digital public infrastructure for agriculture that is open source and interoperable.\nWhat will it be used for? \"This will enable inclusive, farmer-centric solutions through relevant information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs, credit, and insurance, help for crop estimation, market intelligence, and support for growth of agri-tech industry and start-ups,\" the finance minister said.\nKazim Rizvi of The Dialogue opined that this will \"help the agriculture industry to have similar kinds of digital public infrastructure such as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) and ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce).\"\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nPlatform Proposals\nThe Centre is looking to upskill youth using modern technology, particularly by rolling out a Skill India Digital platform that would also serve as a bridge between MSMEs and the youth. They would also have access to entrepreneurship schemes via the platform, Sitharaman revealed in her speech.\nAnother digital platform that was announced as part of the Union Budget 2023 was IGOT Karmayogi. It would specifically aid government employees in their online training.\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nSmartphone Manufacturing Boost\n\"To further deepen domestic value addition in manufacturing of mobile phones, I propose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain [smartphone] parts and inputs like camera lens,\" she said.\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nE-Courts\nA whopping Rs 7,000 crore has been allotted in the Union Budget 2023 to kick off Phase 3 of the Centre's E-Courts project, in an attempt to efficiently administer justice.\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nNational Digital Library\nLibraries are apparently making a comeback, but in a virtual manner. The Centre proposed setting up a national digital library for children and adolescents. The library's catalogue will feature books across geographies, languages, genres and levels, and they will be accessible from any device.\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nSurvey Says?\nBesides stating that the crypto asset market is volatile in nature, the Economic Survey 2022-23 identified fragile backing, increasing complexity, non-transparency, and governance problems as the key issues plaguing the new form of digital assets.\nIt also made a case for taking a global approach to crypto asset regulation.\nIn a subtle nod to the FTX fiasco, the survey said that the \"increasing importance of [centralised crypto exchanges] could force regulators to consider them as systemic financial market infrastructures.\"\nThe energy implications of crypto mining found a mention in the survey as clashing with other public policy objectives.\n\"There are regulatory gaps at each stage when crypto assets are issued, transferred, exchanged, or stored by non-bank entities. Cryptos cross-sector and cross-border nature limits the effectiveness of uncoordinated national approaches.\"\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat They Wanted\nThe key demands of the Indian crypto industry are a reduction in TDS on crypto transactions and allow investors to offset their  losses in one crypto asset against gains in another crypto asset, according to a report by Inc42.\nClarity on the definitions of gross revenue and telecom activities are among the issues raised by Indian telcos, according to a report by The Times of India.\nA robust GST mechanism has been sought by the online gaming industry as the government looks to regulate the sunrise sector.\nSolve for ESOPs such that they are not taxed twice, that is at the time of exercise as well as at the time of sale.\nReform capital gains taxation laws as domestic investors currently have to shell out more than foreign investors in long-term capital gains for unlisted companies.\nRoll out a carbon credit policy so that EV charging service providers can get high returns on investment by selling the credits to environmentally conscious companies.\nAlso Read",

      "body": "Published:\n01 Feb 2023 11:00\nNASAs Marshall Space Flight Center has begun work with IBM to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to discover new insights in its Earth and geospatial science data. The joint effort will apply AI foundation model technology to NASAs Earth-observing satellite data for the first time.\nThese observations are used by scientists to study and monitor Earth. NASA said the data is being collected unprecedented rates and volume, hence it needs new approaches to extract knowledge from these growing data resources. The pair plan to develop an easier way for researchers to analyse and draw insights from the large datasets, based on IBMs foundation model technology.\nAccording to IBM, foundation models are types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabelled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another. These models have rapidly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) technology over the past five years, and IBM is pioneering applications of foundation models beyond language.\nThe beauty of foundation models is they can potentially be used for many downstream applications, said Rahul Ramachandran, senior research scientist at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams. You need teams across different organisations to bring their different perspectives, resources and skillsets.\nIBM and NASA plan to develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations. One project will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASAs Harmonized Landset-Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites.\nBy analysing petabytes of satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields and wildlife habitats, IBM and NASA hope this foundation model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planets environmental systems.\nNASA will also be working with IBM to make Earth science literature easily searchable. IBM has developed a\nNLP\n)\nmodel trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organise the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge. According to IBM, this represents the largest AI workload trained on Red Hats OpenShift software. The fully trained model uses PrimeQA, IBMs open source multilingual question-answering system. Beyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science will be built into NASAs scientific data management and stewardship processes.\nAnother potential IBM-NASA joint project is the construction of a foundation model for weather and climate prediction using MERRA2, a dataset of atmospheric observations. This collaboration is part of NASAs Open Source Science Initiative, a commitment to building an inclusive, transparent and collaborative open science community over the next decade.\nRead more about AI in scientific research\nData is the crown jewels of business, but is often siloed  we speak to the chief data officer at Nasa about developing a data integration culture.\nThe Data Labs Data Summit majored on the ethical use of data, and featured Scottish government minister Tom Arthur, science broadcaster Hannah Fry, and Nasa chief science data officer Kevin Murphy.\nRead more on Artificial intelligence, automation and robotics\nHow the cost-of-living crisis is affecting IT\nReverse cloud migrations: shifting IT back on-premise",

      "body": "Will the government tighten fiscalrope?\nWe had a webinar last week with three stalwarts of Nasscom on a range of issues. For the full discussion, do look at our Facebook page. Here we are reproducing parts of it.\nThere's a slowdown in global tech, theres all these big layoffs happening. But India tech seems relatively to be in a good spot\nKeshav Murugesh\n: We cannot avoid a recession if there's one. But the reality is, the quality of our services, the kind of impact we have created in terms of talent, in terms of technology, in terms of platformisation, means that even if there is a recession, it actually plays into the positive momentum that Indian IT and BPM have.\nI can only tell you at this point in time that from my company's point of view, from the sector point of view, we continue to grow at a very healthy pace. Hiring and investments we're making continue to be very strong. The most important thing is, all of us are putting more money into skilling, reskilling and upskilling our people, waiting for the so-called recession to take our numbers even higher.\nSrikanth, give us a sense of the mood in the startup segment.\nSrikanth Velamakanni: I think some of the layoffs that we're seeing all over the world is related to tech valuations correcting significantly. It is partly because interest rates have gone up. Also, people over-hired during the pandemic as tech became centerstage for every company. But even after the layoffs, the big tech companies are still at October 21 levels in terms of overall headcount. So we have to see that in perspective, and realise that some of these may be just getting the house in order for what seems to be a very disruptive future ahead. We have just seen ChatGPT. It has made everyone take notice that AI is way more real than ever before. It is going to change our jobs. Humans are going to be augmented in all their behaviour. Yet, AI is not going to replace human beings, but human beings who use AI will replace human beings that dont use AI.\nIn deep tech startups, it's a very difficult funding environment right now. So there will potentially be consolidation, a lot of acquisitions. The healthy companies will become healthier and grow faster than the ones who do not get funded, or are not profitable. ChatGPT tells us that if you have a really high quality AI startup, this is the best time to get funded.\nSangeeta Gupta\n, Sr VP & Chief Strategy Officer, Nasscom\nSangeeta, you have an industry-wide perspective. What do you sense?\nSangeeta Gupta: I think everybody is very cautious right now because there are macro economic shifts that are taking place. There is worry of a recession and you have to be ready for it. While demand for technology may be shifting from innovations, to focus on productivity and efficiency, the overall demand has not come down. There are pockets of startups that are facing funding issues. The ability to scale SaaS startups is a challenge, given the slowdown in enterprise software demand. But its far from a gloom and doom scenario.\nWhats the hiring trend?\nSangeeta: In the latest quarter results, most people said that the fresher hiring pipeline is better. And again, comparison with 2021 is not fair, because there was a resurgence of demand, and everybody had to hire a lot more also because of the great resignation. The GCC (global capability centre) segment continues to grow, and the number of global CXO visits to India is a reflection of that.\nSrikanth\n: India is going to add a million people to its workforce every month for the next many, many years. That means a net addition of 100 million in the next 7-8 years, while the rest of the world is flat or declining. So India has become the centerstage for the world in terms of talent. Two, any big company's headquarters may have the highest number of people, but the second biggest location for all of them is India. So India is likely to become the second biggest location for every global company, mark my words, in the next 10-15 years. Multinational companies are seeing India as a strategic place for very high quality R&D and innovation talent. That is a very good situation for us. For the next several years, we must reap this demographic dividend.\nKeshav\n: Nasscom reports talk about 500 potential new GCCs being set up in India (on top of the 1,500-plus that are already there). The reason they're coming is all the good things that have been established here. Over a period of time, some of them may realise their ability to manage GCCs is limited. And that will be an opportunity for many of us (Indian companies) to take out some of these captives. Remember, many of us in the BPM sector came through captives  WNS was formerly British Airways, Genpact was a GE captive.\nAnd then building on the technology stack that the government of India has created for that scale that we have. It's mind boggling for people outside to see our internet consumers at 775 million, telemedicine growing by 500%, 190 crore vaccinations being enabled. Minister\nRajeev Chandrashekhar\nrecently spoke about seven countries now looking at using the India Stack that includes UPI, Cowin, Arogya Setu, Digi Locker. Fast forward a few quarters and see what impact these technologies and platforms have, and how these are used by the government as technology diplomacy. This is really the interesting India story of the future.\nKeshav R Murugesh | Group CEO, WNS\nWhich technologies are India best positioned to lead  AI, quantum?\nSrikanth\n: I think India should focus on AI, partly because I sort of know this industry the most. India already has a third of the world's AI researchers. India is number three in the number of overall research publications  China and the US are at about 150,000 a year, and we are at 50,000. AI requires very high-quality data, and not billions of dollars in hardware and other kinds of things.\nSecond, I would say quantum computing. The government has identified that as an important area and has made an investment. I think with the right kinds of partnerships, we can do it. We're still not investing in the hardware of quantum computers. We need to do that.\nSrikanth Velamakanni | Co-founder & Group Chief Executive, Fractal Analytics\nSangeeta\n: AI is where we have seen enough progress in India, we continue to invest in building on that. That's one place where India can do the whole language mission, as also some of the digital assets that are getting built  the India data management office that is being talked about.\nYou'll also see stuff like the Quantum Mission. I think they've made some progress. But it's very capital intensive, so we'll have to see where we want to put more effort. Also, many of these technologies are converging, so India could lead in some use cases. For example, cancer research, which will combine two or three technologies and make a difference. So maybe we don't just need a technology lens, we need some use case lenses where India can really make a difference.\nStart a Conversation\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
