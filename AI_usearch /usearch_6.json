      "body": "Comment\nSynopsis\nIndia is rightly betting on various factors, which puts it on growth path.  There are some challenges, but a balanced and well-coordinated approach could address these challenges to ensure a sustained economic growth in the future.\nAgencies\nThe Indian economy is projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, with positive indicators such as increasing foreign investment, growth in key sectors such as manufacturing and digital technology, and reforms aimed at improving business conditions. However, there are also challenges such as unrealised potential and demographic dividend which could impact growth. A balanced and well-coordinated approach to addressing these challenges will be important for sustained economic growth in the future.\nKey Highlights of\nFinancial Sector\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field in India, with significant potential for innovation and economic growth. The government has recognized AI's potential and has taken steps to promote its development, including the launch of a national AI strategy and the establishment of AI research centres. The Budget has proposed for the setting up of three centres of excellence for Artificial Intelligence in top educational institutions for realizing the vision of Make AI in India and Make AI work for India. Leading industry players will partner in conducting interdisciplinary research, develop cutting-edge applications and scalable problem solutions in the areas of agriculture, health, and sustainable cities. This will galvanize an effective AI ecosystem and nurture quality human resources in the field.\nThe private sector is also investing heavily in AI, with Indian companies and startup developing innovative AI-powered products and services across a range of industries. The rapidly expanding tech-savvy population and a large pool of engineering and data science talent are driving growth in the AI industry in India.\n11\n12\nDigital India is built on the India stack on the back of which a world altering Digital Public infrastructure (DPIs) and digital private goods (DPGs) are being built using converging exponential technologies for education, agriculture and health care.\nEducation\nThe future of education in India looks promising, with a focus on leveraging technology to enhance the learning experience and improve access to quality education. The government is investing in initiatives aimed at promoting digital literacy and incorporating technology into the classroom, such as the National Digital Library and the Digital India initiative. Several programs, aimed at improving the quality of education, such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for universal elementary education and the Right to Education Act have also been successfully launched.\nTeacher training is set to be re-envisioned through innovative pedagogy, curriculum transaction, continuous professional development, dipstick surveys, and ICT implementation as proposed in the Budget. The District Institutes of Education and Training will be developed as vibrant institutes of excellence for this purpose. In addition, a National Digital Library for children and adolescents will be set-up for facilitating availability of quality books across geographies, languages, genres and levels, and device agnostic accessibility. States will be encouraged to set up physical libraries for them at panchayat and ward levels and provide infrastructure for accessing the National Digital Library resources.\nThe focus of the Budget is on leveraging technology, promoting hands-on learning, and preparing teachers & students for the demands of the 21st-century workforce. This continued investment and commitment to reform, shall catapult the Indian education system to becoming a global leader in delivering high quality accessible education to all.\nAgriculture\nAgriculture in India is likely to be influenced by several factors including advancements in technology, changes in government policies, and shifting consumer preferences. There is potential for increased adoption of precision agriculture and use of technology such as drones and satellite imaging to improve crop yields. The government is also likely to continue investing in infrastructure and support for the agriculture sector, particularly for small and marginal farmers. There may also be a growing demand for organic and sustainable agriculture practices, driven by consumer awareness and health concerns. Additionally, the increasing population and rising incomes may drive further growth in the agriculture sector.\nThe proposition for setting up a digital public infrastructure for agriculture which will be built as an open source, open standard and inter operable public good is just the push required to take the agriculture revolution forward. This will enable inclusive, farmer-centric solutions through relevant information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs and support for growth of agri-tech industry and start-ups.\nThe setting up of an Agriculture Accelerator Fund will inspire young entrepreneurs in rural areas to bring about innovative and affordable solutions for challenges faced by farmers. It will also bring in modern technologies to transform agricultural practices, increase productivity and profitability.\nIndia is the largest producer and exporter of millets or Shree Anna in the world, with a production of over 20 million tonnes annually. The classification of the Indian Institute of Millet Research as the Centre of Excellence for sharing best practices, research and technologies at the international level, will assist in meeting the demands of consumers who are seeking healthy and sustainable food options across the globe.\nHealth Care\nMedical research has been making significant progress in recent years, with a growing focus on developing innovative solutions to health problems in India and around the world. The Indian government has increased investment in medical research and has taken steps to encourage innovation in the sector, including the establishment of research institutions and programs to support young scientists. The budget has proposed setting up of facilities in select Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Labs which will be made available for research by public and private medical college faculty and private sector R&D teams for encouraging collaborative research and innovation. New programmes to promote research and innovation in pharmaceuticals will be taken up through centers of excellence. Further, dedicated multidisciplinary courses for medical devices will be supported in existing institutions to ensure availability of skilled manpower for futuristic medical technologies, high-end manufacturing and research.\nThe Indian pharmaceutical industry is currently poised to become a major contributor to medical research, with many leading Indian drug makers investing heavily in R&D. Additionally, India's large pool of talented scientists and medical",

      "description": "An artificial intelligence (AI) strategy developed by US scientists could accelerate the development of new antibody drugs.",
      "body": "No comments yet\nAn AI strategy developed by US scientists could accelerate the development of new antibody drugs.\nScientists at University of California (UC) San Diego School of Medicine, US, have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategy for discovering high-affinity antibody drugs.\nIn the study, published in Nature Communications, researchers used the approach to identify a new antibody that binds a major cancer target 17-fold tighter than any existing antibody drug. The authors say the pipeline could accelerate the discovery of novel drugs against cancer and other diseases, such as COVID-19 and rheumatoid arthritis.\nIn order to be a successful drug, an antibody has to bind tightly to its target. To find such antibodies, researchers typically start with a known antibody amino acid sequence and use bacterial or yeast cells to produce a series of new antibodies with variations of that sequence. These mutants are then evaluated for their ability to bind the target antigen. The subset of antibodies that work best are then subjected to another round of mutations and evaluations, and this cycle repeats until a set of tightly-binding finalists emerges.\nIn the new study, UC San Diego scientists designed a state-of-the-art machine learning an algorithm to accelerate and streamline these efforts. The approach starts similarly, with researchers generating an initial library of about half a million possible antibody sequences and screening them for their affinity to a specific protein target.\nHowever, instead of repeating this process over and over again, they feed the dataset into a Bayesian neural network which can analyse the information and use it to predict the binding affinity of other sequences.\nOne advantage of their AI model is its ability to report the certainty of each prediction. Unlike a lot of AI methods, our model can actually tell us how confident it is in each of its predictions, which helps us rank the antibodies and decide which ones to prioritize in drug development, said senior author Dr Wei Wang, Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nTo validate the pipeline, the scientists set out to design an antibody against programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1): a protein highly expressed in cancer and the target of several commercially available anti-cancer drugs.\nUsing this approach, they identified a novel antibody that bound to PD-L1 17 times better than atezolizumab, the wild-type antibody approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThis approach is being used to identify promising antibodies against other antigens, such as SARS-CoV-2. The team are also developing additional AI models that analyse amino acid sequences for other antibody properties important for clinical trial success, such as stability, solubility and selectivity.\nBy combining these AI tools, scientists may be able to perform an increasing share of their antibody discovery efforts on a computer instead of at the bench, potentially leading to a faster and less failure-prone discovery process, concluded Wang.\nThere are so many applications to this pipeline, and these findings are really just the beginning.\nRelated topics",

This includes building a national counter-fraud data analytics service and enhancing the use of fraud intelligence across the public sector.\nWorking with Quantexa, the government hopes to not only find those committing fraud, but to use modern technology to stop it from happening in the first place, particularly with public sector net debt having reached 2.5tn in December 2022.\nPSFA CEO Mark Cheeseman, who previously led the creation of the governments Counter Fraud Profession (CFP), said fraudsters are a capable and committed adversary and the way they commit fraud is diverse and evolving.\nAs criminals develop more sophisticated tools, we too must innovate and modernise our approach to prevent fraud. By bringing together expertise and tools from the public sector and private sector, we will raise our ambition and challenge ourselves to increase our impact on this often unseen and underestimated crime, he said. \nBacked by 23m funding, the PSFA reports to both HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office and aims to share best practices on counter-fraud across all public bodies, including devolved administrations and local governments.\nIt is also planning to run a unit to coordinate, facilitate and share data and intelligence across central government. The PSFA is part of a wider government initiative to combat public sector fraud, which is estimated to be worth around 33bn each year.\nRead more about government and data analytics\nGovernment\nDCMS loses government data policy\nto the Cabinet Office.\nCabinet Office minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe said fraud against the public purse is unacceptable and were stepping up the fight against those who wish to profit off the backs of taxpayers.\nThrough the use of cutting-edge technology, the PSFA will use data and AI to help us in the fight against fraudsters, she added.\nThe government previously signed another deal with Quantexa, in October 2021, to help combat Covid-19 loan scheme fraud. During the pandemic, fraudsters abused the governments loan scheme, with a number of businesses making fraudulent claims. The contract with Quantexa was part of the governments response to those criminal activities.\nAs part of the contract, the government used Quantexas\nContextual Decision Intelligence\n(CDI) platform, which enables customers to create a connected view of [their] data to reveal relationships between people, places and organisations.

While some are curious about how they would look in an action movie or as a robot, others take it to another level to find out how the world would look at its best or worst. In light of it, an artist named Madhav Kohli took to his Instagram account to paint a few pictures showcasing how India might have looked like if it was never conquered. What if India was never conquered? reads the text on the first image.\nFor those unversed, India was conquered by the Turks and Afghans in the 10th and 11th centuries. When the nation was adopting the Mughal rules, the Britishers found the land and decided to invade it in the 1600s. The period of British rule lasted till 1947 when India gained independence from Britain.\nApart from that, in 326 BC, a Greek invasion took place in India when Alexander the Great crossed the Indus river and advanced into Punjab. He then challenged king Porus, ruler of the kingdom between the rivers Jhelum and Chenab.\nMadhav shares a few AI arts of how India would have looked if it was never conquered. The stills show a land with a high level of infrastructure but without losing its cultural and religious values. A land of deities, with a hint of modernization. People can be seen preserving their cultural values, ethics, and attires while accepting the change, and cars running in the streets with an ultra-designed monument ahead, giving the idea of a different world.\nFrom a huge idol of Lord Shiva to Ganga Ghat in Banaras, Beautiful lighting and boat rides can also be seen reducing pollution and increasing the nations scenic beauty. From the well-maintained forts to the Space centers built amid mountains in isolated places, the visuals look nothing less than a Hollywood movie scene.\nTake a look:",

      "body": "Updated 11 mins ago\nAndrew Evers | CNBC\nIn just a couple of months, the question-and-answer chatbot ChatGPT has become so popular that it's not unusual for users to see a message saying it's at capacity and can't handle any more queries. According to UBS, ChatGPT was averaging about 13 million visitors per day by the end of January.\nOpenAI, the San Francisco-based startup behind ChatGPT, has some big backers including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Khosla Ventures. Microsoft also has invested in the company and has reportedly considered adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine.\n\"Unlike some of the other hyped technology sectors in the past few years, this has a very real application both for individuals and for enterprises right now,\" Forrester analyst Rowan Curran told CNBC.\nChatbots have been around for a while, but most have been tailored toward very specific tasks such as answering basic customer service questions about your phone bill. ChatGPT is much more sophisticated due to the wide-sweeping data on which it has been trained.\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox.\nSign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\n\"OpenAI doesn't reveal specific data that they use to train. We do know that it's a ton of data,\" says CNBC technology reporter Jonathan Vanian. \"It surfs the web, spools all that internet data. They do Wikipedia entries, a lot of archived books.\"\nChatGPT is part of a growing field of AI known as generative AI. The technology has venture capitalists excited. Funding for generative AI companies reached $1.37 billion in 2022 alone, according to Pitchbook. While ChatGPT is free to use, OpenAI recently announced a new $20/month subscription plan that gives members additional benefits such as access to ChatGPT even during peak times.\n\"Most of AI in the last couple of decades has really been around analyzing existing data,\" says Gaurav Gupta, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \"Generative AI is very different. It allows you to create brand new content. That content can be text like a news article or poetry or marketing copy, a website. It could be video. It could even be audio, like creating brand new music.\"\nMoney Report\n5 mins ago",

      "description": "Deep dive discussion with AI investment FinTech firm to understand what AI represents and how it is being applied to investment management.",
      "body": "Follow\nSummary\nDeep dive discussion with AI investment FinTech firm to understand what AI represents and how it is being applied to investment management.\nApplications include a family of AI-powered ETFs, AI-powered trading tools, and an AI Risk Calculator for the U.S. equity market.\nAI vs traditional quant methods is compared and contrasted.\nExploring the dynamic between AI technology and the humans (data scientists, investment managers) that design, enabled, and deploy it.\nNatee127/iStock via Getty Images\n[Artificial Intelligence ((or AI)) - from popular culture with Terminator warnings to early high-profile applications like driverless cars - has built up some biases and unfavorable connotations. This has led to a great deal of skepticism in applying AI to compelling\nmodern problems we are actively grappling with, especially in investment management. The reality is that AI is a tool born from a marriage between great need and technology to address data-rich challenges and uncertainty. For investment managers, it represents a highly tech-enabled toolkit that can enhance their current research, security selection, and trading capabilities.\nTo better understand where we are in the process of integrating AI into investment management, we reached out to new Institute member firm South Korean-based Qraft Technologies and both Marcus Kim, Founder & CEO and Francis Geeseok Oh, Head of\nAI ETFs. Qraft is a pioneer in launching some of the first AI-powered ETFs on the market, a series of AI-powered electronic trading tools, and the developer of the AI Risk Indicator which forecasts risk in the U.S. equity market for the coming week\n.]\nHortz: Can you help define for us what exactly is AI and what comprises it? Does it represent one specific monolithic type of program or an arsenal of different tools and approaches?\nKim: At its simplest, AI is designed to simulate human intelligence using machines programmed to learn and think like humans. There is a wide range of algorithms and techniques used to create intelligent machines, there isn't just one specific program or approach. And AI is ubiquitous in everyday life, think of virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri, Google Maps for real-time navigation, Tesla's full self-driving capability, or a Netflix show recommendationand those are just household names. AI-powered client service chatbots are common, AI is increasingly used to distinguish abnormal from normal findings in diagnostic medical imaging, and at Qraft, we are on a mission to transform investing using artificial intelligence.\nOh: Let me jump in and add one topical AI-powered tool to the list: ChatGPT.\nKim: Yes, ChatGPT is a great example of an AI innovation that's increasing productivity and efficiency, and its output is largely accurate. Similarly, at Qraft we are using AI to extend the skilled human's investment capabilities by creating investment solutions that aim to withstand volatile markets and outperform over market cycles. Our AI offerings quickly learn and adapt to real-time investment data, market data, and unstructured data, seeking to identify meaningful patterns and signals amid the noise of millions of data points and billions of data combinations.\nOh: We call our process \"human-assisted AI.\" While we train our AI tools to learn and automatically respond to data at a scope and speed humans alone cannot rival, AI in investments is not independent of human assistance. We often remind clients that AI means artificial intelligence, not artificial intuition, and not all situations can be addressed with an algorithm.\nKim: Intuition is what's behind the so-called \"gut instinct.\"\nOh: Exactly. And Qraft could not have achieved our success to date without our teams of data scientists and data engineers, who bring their passion, inspiration, emotions, and intuition to work every day to design the algorithms and develop our investment solutions. Our teams of human investment experts are the ones who envision and define our solutions and partner with our clients to customize a solution to meet their needs, who partner with our data teams to define and develop the algorithms that drive our solutions, and finally who supervise our investment strategies.\nKim: At the core of everything we do at Qraft is our commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards as we develop and deploy our AI solutions, and ethics is guided by humans as well.\nWhy use AI vs traditional quant methods? How would you compare and contrast these different investment tools?\nOh: An analogy we have used to compare the two is that investing with traditional statistical-based quant methods is like navigating with a paper map, which has static routes laid out and you, as the navigator, must research and manually plot your course on the map. Investing with an AI-driven quant strategy is like using a satellite-based navigation application to secure a fast and accurate assessment of real-time conditions, recommending the most efficient route to your destination based on data and predictive analytics that you do not see, as well as your specific parameters, like \"avoid tolls,\" for example.\nBoth methods will get you to your destination, but using the latest technology that is constantly learning from and automatically adapting to new data and changing market conditions presents a significant advantage over traditional quant methods, which may be challenged to quickly integrate new data sources and adapt to changing market environments. In our experience, most quant shops use some form of AI, but how much AI is incorporated and the degree of sophistication runs the gamut.\nKim: With traditional quant, it can be easier to explain the investment rationale for why a decision was made. Conversely, to some extent AI-driven models are seen as a \"black box,\" and some investors can really struggle to embrace an AI model's output because there may not be an obvious investment rationale for a recommendation. There's a bit of a belief that if an economic explanation is unavailable, the relationship or recommendation cannot possibly be valid.\nBut referring back to our tech-led approach, AI methods are purely data-driven. There is no preconceived bias from prior research or investment theories that may have been applicable in some prior market environment, but which may not be valid in the current regime. That is the beauty of the AI model, the flexibility to quickly adapt to the data autonomously, without the explicit need for re-programming.\nCan you give us a few examples of how an AI technique can outperform a traditional quant method or solve a problem that a traditional quant technique could not?\nKim: Traditional quant methods take the perspective that relationships between data are linear. But today, to generate alpha above and beyond a benchmark, we really need to be looking at data and the relationships among all data points with a multi-dimensional, non-linear lens. Advances in computing power combined with massive and ever-expanding data sets have helped AI ",

This same account can be used across all Economic Times B2B portals.\nBy Ritika Sakhuja\nNew Delhi: Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister of India, announced in the Lok Sabha that under the Union Budget 2023-24, the ruling government will allocate specialised focus to boosting Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and innovation in India. The AI sector is closely linked to diagnostics and hence could result in significant modifications in the industry, inform domain experts.\nAnnouncing the last full budget in parliament before a general election due next year, the centre informed that they aim to open three centres for the excellence of Artificial Intelligence, which will be set up in top educational institutions. In her budget speech, Sitaraman, mentioned that this will allow leading industry players to partner up in conducting interdisciplinary research, and develop cutting-edge applications, and scalable problem solutions, especially in the healthcare sector.\nSeveral diagnostic players spoke to ETHealthworld post-budget and informed that the centre's decision on opening three AI centres of excellence in top Indian institutions will help in creating sustainable healthcare solutions as AI research plays a crucial role in precision diagnostics and it will help in developing indigenous products for the industry.\nCommenting that the increased emphasis on AI research and development is unquestionably a step in the right direction, Dheeraj Jain, Founder & MD, Redcliffe Labs said,  The AI centres will help create sustainable healthcare solutions. This will eventually benefit the public and the diagnostic sector at large.\nResonating Jains comment, Hasmukh Rawal, MD, Mylab suggested, Setting up the Centers of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence is a great step. It can have a major impact across sectors including diagnostics as AI plays a significant role in precision diagnosis. These centres will further stimulate innovation in the country and can potentially transform patient care.\nWelcoming the budget, Dr Charit Bhograj, Founder & CEO, Tricog Health said, With the emphasis on AI in healthcare at the centres of excellence, the culmination of medicine and technology will drive advancements in patient care and help achieve better health outcomes for all.\nThe increased focus on boosting AI in the union budget also emphasizes the importance of accelerating the development of new technology and solutions. Relaying this sentiment, Rawal added, Government's thrust to research and innovation is a step in the right direction. Investment in R&D and innovation is critical for developing science and technology-based solutions and indigenous products to address the challenges of human health, and making healthcare accessible and affordable.\nAdding to it Jatin Mahajan, Secretary, Association of Diagnostic Manufacturers of India and Managing Director, J Mitra & Company said, This will drive the make in India initiative, and since the diagnostic segment has AI as a potent growth component, we are hopeful of this driving a positive growth for the segment as well.\nCalling the Budget extremely comprehensive and inclusive, Surajit Chakrabartty, CFO, MedGenome Labs said, Our Governments emphasis on innovation, digitisation and R&D has always been evident and has stimulated growth over time. A nation's stability and resilience can be enhanced by the application of science and technology, which are important catalysts for change. Laying greater impetus on building a culture of research in the healthcare sector and encouraging digitisation will further enhance Indias healthcare infrastructure and delivery.\nHowever, compared to the pre-budget expectations of the diagnostic sector, the Union Budget 2023-24 missed several key aspects that could have proven integral to Indias diagnostic boost viz exemption of GST on diagnostic services, promoting investment in genomics, accreditation of NABH and NABL labs to expand quality diagnostics in tier III-IV cities, increased standardisation of diagnostic tests, reduction of import duty on diagnostic equipment, and increasing investment in PPP among others.\nAdding to this sentiment, A Ganesan, Group Vice Chairman, Neuberg Diagnostics, recommended, \"I believe one of the major problems at the moment is medical establishments such as hospitals and diagnostic centres often face delays in receiving payment from government departments like CGHS, NHS, and ESI Hospitals, which can cause working capital difficulties for MSMEs. I believe that the Finance Minister should consider raising the income tax allowance in respect of payments made under the Annual Health Check under Section 80D.\"\nExpressing the Union Budget being in line with the Amrit Kaal vision of creating sustainable healthcare infrastructure in the country, Dr Ravi Gaur, MD, Founder & Director, DRG Path Lab said, \"It good but a bit more Amrit needs to be infused into the healthcare for wellness and well-being of human capital.\"\nThe long pending demand for zero per cent GST in healthcare, increased allocation for preventive healthcare, universal health insurance, and the adoption of new technologies-based personalised diagnostics, which are an essential and futuristic step for improving quality of life and reducing the burden on overburdened existing healthcare facilities, has been overlooked. India needs a higher allocation of funds in the healthcare sector for improved access to quality healthcare. The investment in healthcare is an investment in human capital, which is a must to build up a healthy nation, which in turn will ultimately impact the economy of the nation, added Dr Gaur.\nThe industry, expressing mixed reactions, hailed the budget as a step in the right direction with respect to boosting innovation and R&D in India, but at the same time highlighted the crucial diagnostic aspects that should have been invested in but were missed in the budget.\nFollow and connect with us on Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin,",

      "body": "Meta aims to make 2023 the year of efficiency, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said while announcing the company's fourth-quarter earnings report.    The social media giant, which had a tumultuous 2022, has surprised its investors and Wall Street with a better-than-expected performance in the last three months of FY2022.    However, the talking point of the town is the company's plan to focus on austerity in 2023. Last year was a forgettable one for most tech companies. Meta was among the most affected.    The uncertain economy and falling advertising revenue put the parent of Facebook and Instagram in a chokehold that seemed very hard to get out of.    The company's new earnings report, however, suggests that it has finally found a way. That should give hope to other companies. In the last quarter of 2022, Meta recorded $32.17 billion in revenue, down 4% from $33.67 billion in the year prior. However, the company's revenue was ahead of the $31.5 billion analysts projected.    The tech giant's net income fell by 55% from $10.28 billion in Q4 of 2021 to $4.65 billion in 2022.    Its costs and expenses ballooned 22% year-over-year to $25.8 billion. For nearly two decades since its inception, Meta went through a phase of hyper-growth. Last year, the company recorded negative growth for the first time, indicating the end of that phase.    In a response to this, Meta has cut its expenditure and total expenses projections this year. The reduced outlook says that the company is adjusting well to the new reality. Meta will cut its costs to a range of $89-95 billion, down from the previously expected $94-100 billion.    The company's capital expenditure will be cut to $30-33 billion from the previous outlook of $34-37 billion, courtesy of less expenditure on data center construction.    The tech giant plans to shift to a new cost-effective architecture that can support both AI and non-AI workloads. During the earnings call, Zuckerberg said, It's very hard to really crank on efficiency while you're growing that quickly. I just think we're in a different environment now.    We're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial, he added.    The CEO also reiterated his point about changing Meta's organizational structure focused on middle-management. Meta's user numbers were another bright sport from the latest earnings report. The company's family of apps grew their daily active users (DAU) by 5% to 2.96 billion.    For all the talks about Facebook's slow and certain death, its DAU increased 4% year-over-year to 2 billion.    The company's advertising business fell 4% to $31.3 billion - another better-than-expected result.",

      "description": "Artificial Intelligence is waiting for its first tangible mass-market application to burst open the door, just as ecommerce did in the late 90s. It is now up to entrepreneurs to start the rush",
      "body": "As chatbot sophistication grows, AI debate intensifies\nJust like in the late 90s, when everybody was convinced that the internet was going to change our lives, we in the present world have a broad consensus that AI will do the same (hopefully for the better). Just like entrepreneurs rushed out in the late 90s to build their dot-com firms, entrepreneurs today are just about starting the push the limits of what is possible with AI. Does that mean we are heading for a bubble? I certainly hope so. An AI bubble, just like the dot-com bubble, will lead to a period of experimentation where entrepreneurs will have the resources to push the limits of possible applications. While some speculators and even genuine investors will bear the brunt, the outcome will create the next innovative firm which will change our way of life. AI firms with the right value proposition are likely to lead and shape human lives over the next millennia.\nSo how far along are we in this cycle as far as AI is concerned? I feel we are in a phase where only Big Tech firms are using AI. The rush to establish an AI-driven firm is yet to come. Data is the heart of any artificial intelligence we can build right now. We are currently in an age where data is collected and controlled largely by internet firms and some large financial service firms. The debate about whether data is owned by the individual who created the data or by the platform where the data was created is yet to be settled. Regulations, like the PSI directive in the EU, are only just starting to loosen the grip on data. Whether this kind of legislation becomes normal in the rest of the world remains to be seen.\nAlso read:\nHow AI will democratise strategy for the next industrial revolution\nAI is also waiting for its first tangible mass-market application. A driverless car or AI-driven guard bot is likely to be the harbinger of the AI rush. For early-stage entrepreneurs, there are headwinds such as access to data and raising capital. I believe these headwinds will weaken significantly in the coming years. AI is primarily being applied in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing which are quite impressive, but we dont have a tangible mass-market application yet. When a mass market application comes and when the grip of a few firms on data loosens, we will see a rush to build the next multi-billion-dollar firm. For early-stage entrepreneurs, the best bet is to look for an application where AI is yet to be adopted. Just like internet entrepreneurs redefined our shopping habits, AI entrepreneurs should look to redefine the old way of doing things. For example, AI drones could be used for detecting potholes or AI-driven guard bots could be used for security. The opportunity to use AI to incrementally improve what seems to be a trivial task like guarding a perimeter has tremendous potential and use. AI-assisted farming is another area where there remains a significant opportunity to experiment. The best opportunities for the application of AI are in the real world instead of the virtual world or the digital world.\nEarly-stage entrepreneurs should first educate themselves about the basics of AI. A basic understanding of the algorithms that drive AI will help entrepreneurs understand the nuances of gathering data to build an AI. It will also help them understand how AI applications are built and used. This basic knowledge will enable early-stage entrepreneurs to seek and hire the right talent to build their products. Also, professional investors often look for founders with some background and understanding of the field.\nArmed with just the basics, early-stage entrepreneurs can then go out and look for applications in the real world. Identifying these opportunities would be the first big step in the right direction. After this, the entrepreneur can start thinking of collecting the data which will be the heart of the startup. At least in the current phase of AI evolution driven by supervised models. With the right team and right data building, an AI application in the cloud is within every entrepreneurs grasp. A minimum viable product (MVP) built in the cloud can be used to pitch your idea to professional investors. With some tailwinds and a good idea coupled with a working MVP, raising funds should not be the most difficult part. Finally, with the funds raised, scaling your firm and taking it to the next level will become a possibility.\nWhile this sounds easy on paper, it is perhaps the most difficult thing to do on this planet. However, if you want to attempt something difficult, always do it in a fast-growing industry. The AI growth story is just about getting started.\nDr Aditya Narvekar, Assistant Professor & Deputy Director, Students Engagement and Enhancement  Bachelor of Data Science, SP Jain School of Global Management\nCheck out our Festive offers upto Rs.1000/- off website prices on subscriptions + Gift card worth Rs 500/- from Eatbetterco.com.

      "description": "The green growth policy outlook is definitely progressive as it doesnt see agriculture in isolation but as a holistic system",
      "body": "February 02, 2023 12:28:02 IST\nRepresentational image. Moneycontrol\nWhen it comes to agriculture, the union budget 2023-24 was quite unexpected. Moving away from convention, the Finance Minister unveiled a new policy outlook- Green growth where agriculture and environment come together for the Amrit Kaal. Creation of natural farming and AI infrastructure seemed to be the top priorities of this agri-budget.\nThe big announcements included the plans for transitioning 10 million farmers towards natural farming, creation of natural farming infrastructure like 10,000 bio-input resource centre, setting up agriculture accelerator fund for agri starts-up, 20 lakh crore funding for animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy, creation of digital public infrastructure, making India a millet hub for the world and more.\nUnder the green growth agenda, the government also announced a coastal mangrove scheme MISHTI  Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes. Now mangroves earn one of the highest carbon revenue and the government wants to promote it in all coastal land available. If done right, this alone can create additional carbon revenue for the government and communities involved.\nBut is the government thinking of carbon dollars? Both the FM and the recent economic survey report mention carbon stocks of our forests, and FM even mentioned a new scheme for optimal wetland use program called Amrit Darohar, which fits right into the carbon bandwagon. In the next three years, this project will enhance biodiversity, carbon stock, eco-tourism opportunities and income generation for local communities.\nAnd a GOBAR-dhan scheme announcing the 500 new bio-waste collection and processing centres. The FM has galvanised the biogas program by adding 200 compressed biogas plants to this years budget and also made bold announcements towards carbon neutrality through natural based solutions.\nThe FM also announced a Green credit program to incentivise environmentally friendly actions of companies, individuals and local bodies, and provide additional help to expand their scope. This could be a precursor to compulsory carbon compliances.\nNow for AI and agriculture, three new AI centres of excellence will begin soon to understand how AI can be integrated with Indian farming. The government intends to create an open source digital public infrastructure for agriculture to have relevant information for crop planning, farm inputs, etc together. In short, an agri-data stack that can then be fed into the AI systems.\nMoving back to crops, cotton also figured in the union budget for cluster development. Ambitiously, the government announced that a special cluster will be developed between industry, farmers and suppliers to grow long staple cotton.\nHeavy tax concessions were also made for ethanol. The government can encourage diverting excessive sugar into biofuel production. The current decision impacts sugarcane farmers and industry at large.\nAs for seeds and post-harvest storage, the winds seem to sail towards decentralisation. Government has shown intent to create smaller grain storage centres across the hinterland, to empower the farmers against price fluctuations. Potentially, this scheme can be implemented best by providing DBTs (Direct Benefit Transfers) to farmers for storage building or renting grains storage. FPO (Farmers Producer Organisation) can also play an important role here.\nFor seed, there is a design to create seed villages, which help in seed breeding and become local seed hubs. For most crops, seeds cost 5-8 per cent of the total farm input kitty, and if some it can be recirculated into rural economy by farmers owned seed co-operatives, economy and biodiversity both stand to benefit.\nAnother big step was the 2200 crore allotted to the clean plant program for good planting material. Given the new changes of climate change, India needs to have higher genetic diversity and disease resistant plants and germ plasm to develop healthy trees. And improvement of horticulture genetics and add many folds to the farmers incomes.\nOn natural farming the governments intention seems clear. Natural farming had lacked infrastructure and farm supplies. Empowered by DBTs the farmers instead of chemical fertilisers can also choose organic inputs. This policy push will not only help ease the fertiliser subsidy bills, but also help India meet her carbon needs much faster, while encouraging a healthy diet.\nAlthough more energy is needed to strengthen the Indian organic certifications. Recently, the USDA cancelled the equivalence of Indian certifications like NPOP or PGS, organic exporters were hoping the budget provides additional funds to improve on certification mechanisms.\nThe other big challenge to natural farming comes from GM mustard, if India loses its non-gm tag, our organic exports and organic farming could really suffer. The budget also makes new allotments for beekeeping, and the GM threat could undermine current efforts. The same applies to long staple cotton projects. The Herbicide tolerant (HT) Bt cotton is spreading wilding across the Indian cotton belts. And if the project clusters are also contaminated, we would risk this project too.\nNow lets review the numbers. Agriculture budget has been reduced from 151,521 crores (2022-23) to 144, 214 crores in 2023-24. Even flagship schemes like PM Kisan and PM Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) havent been spared and had their budgets chopped by about 12 per cent and 13 per cent respectively.\nThe overall share of agriculture in the total budget has plummeted to 3.20 per cent from the previous 3.84 per cent. The government has also been silent on demand of its very own RSS affiliated Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) who were expecting a fair price system for farmers, after their recent protest in New Delhi. It may be cumbersome for the government to run so many programs on a reduced budget.\nThe AI vision for agriculture may also be headed for some roadblocks. First would be economic viability. Farm inputs are already rising each day, so how will the marginal farmers be able to avail expensive AI based softwares? Or even run a smart phone with this complex softwares? India has many languages and lower rural literacy; it would be interesting to see how many people or farmers can avail benefits of this new technology. Even if this AI can predict weather and untimely rain, farmers would make huge savings.\nBut moving to sweeter things, the bio-fuel agenda of the government also needs careful introspection because we have limited land, and diverting the more fertile sugarcane growing areas for biofuel and ethanol could bring down land under grains and other food essentials.\nNow if we really want to make India into a millet hub, we need to reintroduce nutritious millets like ragi, sava, ramdana, etc back in our diets. The mid day meals around the country should include the local millets. PDS systems should have millets along with rice and wheat and the government should procure summer millets like jo",

      "body": "The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.The new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT's ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.OpenAI cautions that its new tool  like others already available  is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text \"is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes,\" said Jan Leike, head of OpenAI's alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.\"Because of that, it shouldn't be solely relied upon when making decisions,\" Leike said.Teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched November 30 as a free application on OpenAI's website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.By the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.The Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.\"We can't afford to ignore it,\" Robinson said.The district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a \"personal tutor\" or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.School districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.\"The initial reaction was 'OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT,'\" said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that \"this is the future\" and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\"I think we would be nave if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power,\" said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the company's detection service is in place.OpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.The longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text  a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\"  and the tool will label it as either \"very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely\" AI-generated.But much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, it's not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.\"We don't fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally,\" Leike said. \"There's really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.\"\"Like many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that it's inappropriate for use in their classrooms,\" said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. \"We don't really push them one way or another.\"(SJ/VOA)",

Moreover, these Plus users can access faster response time and will receive prioritised access to the new features. These features are said to be similar to the leaked ChatGPT Pro and the ChatGPT Plus.According to OpenAI, the company is making sure to make several changes to the AI platform based on the feedback it receives during the research preview. Interestingly, the company has also confirmed to launch its ChatGPT API, a business integrated ChatGPT platform which will be integrated to existing apps and services.Meanwhile, the company unveiled a tool thats intended to help show if text has been authored by an artificial intelligence program and passed off as human.The tool will flag content written by OpenAIs products as well as other AI authoring software. However, the company said, it still has a number of limitations  so it should be used as a complement to other methods of determining the source of text instead of being the primary decision-making tool.In the Microsoft Corp.-backed companys evaluations, only 26 per cent of AI-written text was correctly identified. It also flagged nine per cent of human-written text as being composed by AI.The tool, called a classifier, will be available as a web app, along with some resources for teachers, the company said in a statement Tuesday. The popularity of ChatGPT has given rise to authorship concerns as students and workers use the bot to create reports and content and pass it off as their own. Its also spurred worries about the ease of auto-generated misinformation campaigns.",

ChatGPT took the world by storm due to its ability to carry out almost human-like conversations. Now, its developers are improving it further so it is able to chat with you, answer follow-up questions, and challenge incorrect assumptions. OpenAI announced on February 1st that the new subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, will be available for $20/month. This pilot will be initially rolled out for the United States and subsequently invitations will be sent to people from the waitlist. Subscribers will receive a number of benefits. Openai.com lists these: General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times, Faster response times, Priority access to new features and improvements. The paid version of ChatGPT is made available so as to support the free version of the chatbot. OpenAi said, We love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT. By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access availability to as many people as possible.  Why ChatGPT plus? ChatGPT plus will help keep the chatbot that is available for the public free. The research preview version that was launched for free helped the developers assess the chatbots strengths and weaknesses. The paid version too will continue to be monitored through user feedback to upgrade the software.  OpenAI said that the chatbot has so far added value to peoples lives by helping draft & edit content, brainstorm ideas. It has aided in programming and also helped people learn new topics. Future plans Open AI said that besides continuous improvements in the chatbot, it is also actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability.",

According to Cointelegraph, the technical advancements and macroeconomic factors that will affect trading performance in 2023 were surveyed by 835 traders from 60 different \"global locations\" for the seventh edition of JPMorgan's e-Trading Edit. The survey was run from January 3 to January 23, 2023. The survey found that traders were reluctant to deal in digital assets. Only 14% of respondents indicated they would either start trading in digital assets this year or continue to do so, as reported by Cointelegraph. Cointelegraph further noted that the remaining 14% of respondents stated that while they had no plans to invest this year, they might in the subsequent five years. Separately, the survey found that 53% of traders believed that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-related technologies would have a greater impact on the future of trading than did 12% of traders.

      "description": "The absence of significant efforts in the Budget to augment revenue relish is as welcome as the emphasis on societal aspects",
      "body": "Ashwin Ravindranath\nAshwin Ravindranath\nThe last full Budget of the government before the elections was signalled by the PM as one that would address the aspirations of Indians and make India a ray of hope, in an otherwise uncertain comity of economies. The Economic Survey underlined extraneous pressures, consequent internal stresses like inflation, and climate change commitments. It dwelt at length on agriculture, social infrastructure and employment, beyond the usual suspects of inflation and industry.\nGiven this backdrop, the absence of significant efforts in the Budget to augment revenue relish (to borrow from the Survey) is as welcome as the emphasis on societal aspects, aptly titled Big Tent. The expected muting of demand for exports has necessitated a domestic economic focus, evident in the thread of announcements. The government has continued to make a Keynesian bet on capex with a 33% growth in spend. Winning this bet requires the expected crowding in of private investment, something that has been slow in coming thus far. Conspicuous by their absence were announcements on Production Linked Incentives (PLI), a key driver of private investment.\nThere is a continued pivot in the governments focus on agriculture and allied areas, from productivity and price to democratising market information, reducing dependence on chemicals and using technology to solve problems. There is an attempt to remedy foundational skills like reading, which the ASER 2022 reflects as having declined during the pandemic years, from already worrying levels.\nThe Budget brings AI to society at large, with three Centres of Excellence, focussed on applications in agriculture, health and sustainable cities. Indias focus on the societal impact of AI must be juxtaposed with that of China, which sought the dominance of commanding heights and the first mover advantage for economic and military benefit.\nWith proposed changes in slabs and surcharges, the new tax regime (sans rebates/reliefs) becomes attractive for middle-income taxpayers and HNIs. A notable absence was a response to the clamour for taxing the wealthy and their wealth, to redistribute assets/income. The proposed deferral of tax deductions for MSME dues to the time of payment should accelerate the flow of cash to MSMEs, which should also benefit from the enhanced limit for the presumptive tax regime.\nCertain tax proposals often tend to mutate beyond their origins in previous Budgets. One such is the proposed taxation of excess premiums paid by non-resident investors in Indian companies. We hope that it does not become a bone of contention with the tax administration, dampening foreign investment. Another concerning change appears prima facie to grant extraordinary powers to the income-tax authorities to withhold refunds due to taxpayers and this, therefore, could be an immediate cause of concern.\nThe effort to consolidate and rationalise customs duty rates and provide clarity on exemptions for importers is positive. Basic customs duty has been reduced for inputs required by certain sectors in the Make in India campaign  lab-grown diamonds, consumer electricals and electronics, EV and green technology products. Concerning however is the restriction of GST credit on CSR expenses of companies.\nThe Budget has traditionally represented multiple trade-offs. Immediate needs like welfare, sectoral uplifts, servicing debt, fuelling exports, paying for the oil, and enhancing employment and disposable income vie with strategic items such as relief from tax disputes, structural adjustments and investments. Not unsurprisingly, even such an illustrative list makes the task look daunting.\nJudgments on Budgets are made too quickly, driven often by the need for instant gratification. The successful performance of the economy and the realisation of well-justified optimism depend only partly on what we heard today. A lot will depend on the storms of geopolitics, geoeconomics and developed market slowdowns not ravaging the Indian coasts and oil prices staying benign.\n(The writer is Tax Partner, EY India.

      "body": "21 min ago\nNick Jacobs\nFor the past two weeks, all Ive been hearing about has been references to ChatGPT. For those of you who have not been exposed to this, I will share with you some information I garnered from a Thompson Reuters Foundation publication, Context.\nChatGPT is described as an artificial intelligence AI tool that can generate human-like text. The article went on to indicate that technologists see ChatGPT as a disruptor of many jobs. The tool comes from OpenAI, a for-profit research organization co-founded by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman, and backed by billions in funding from Microsoft.\nSome advocates predict ChatGPT will result in automating jobs away from human beings; although critics have argued that AI and robotics do not yet have the capability for that. The operative phrase in that sentence was do not yet have the capability\nIts just a matter of time for these self-learning programs to develop that potential. But already, some schools and universities have responded by limiting or banning its use by students.\nOf course, for any of us who have been active online since the late 1980s none of this is a surprise.\nIn 1968, Boomers were exposed to the spaceship crews interaction with AI HAL in the movie, 2001, a Space Odyssey. Consequently, many of us have anticipated the arrival of artificial intelligence that would eventually surpass our human capabilities.\nFor the better part of the decade when I maintained a residence in Pittsburgh for its airport access, not a day went by when I wasnt being passed by a self-driving car with a driver behind the wheel ensuring it didnt kill someone. Not much later, we saw self-driving Coors beer trucks on the news and immediately wondered about the hundreds of thousands of truck drivers who could be negatively impacted.\nLike the replacement of auto workers, turnpike toll takers, supermarket check-out clerks, and the like, robotic and AI automation is no stranger to our world.\nOne of the arguments against this form of AI is that it still does not have the capability or capacity to emulate the human and emotional side of analysis.\nIn fact, in the most recent edition of the Journal of Healthcare Management, the editor asked the AI platform, the GPT-3 model, to answer the question What information do health care leaders need to manage complex health care issues and to make effective strategic decisions?\nHonestly, when I read the artificially generated answer, I was really impressed. The editor wisely pointed out, however, that the answer had touched all the intellectual descriptors of the question but had failed miserably on the personal and human intelligence needed to be an effective leader in the field. He gave AI an A for effort and an F for its ability to put human conditions to the forefront when evaluating health care strategy.\nWill AI be able to write term papers, press releases, instruction manuals, legal briefs, stories, jokes or monologues and lesson plans? Will it be capable of creating documents for insurance companies, professional technical journals, and even scripts for movies? That seems to be the plan.\nOnce while reflecting upon my own fathers brief life of 58 years, I made the following observations. He was alive for the Wright Brothers first flight and the walk on the moon. He first drove a Model T and his last car had automatic windows, air conditioning and cruise control. He went from having only newspapers and magazines, to radio and ended with color television.\nThe sad reality, however, is that all these technological advances did not equate to human emotional and intellectual advances. We have access on our phones to all the incredible knowledge ever generated by the greatest minds who ever lived, but were still killing each other, destroying our planet, and thriving on greed and negative groupthink. Maybe AI could give us nice people chip implants, too? Now, that could work.\nNick Jacobs, of Windber, is a health care consultant and author of the book Taking the Hell Out of Healthcare.\nNick Jacobs, of Windber, is a health care consultant and author of the book Taking the Hell Out of Healthcare.\nTags",

If they exploit AI, so must we in our response and defence, writes Martin Rehak\nOur expanding relationship with the digital world transformed the opportunities for financial crimes. As criminals become more sophisticated, so too must be our response. As they get better at it, exploiting the newest technologies, so must we.\nWe are getting used to living our life without the need of physically going places. Shopping is delivered to our doors and banking can be done from a smartphone. The pandemic accelerated this shift to the digital economy, and while the potential benefits are endless, so too are the opportunities for innovative criminal schemes.\nIn the same vein, banks have also become more digital. Going to a bank branch is now rare. New customers can be onboarded virtually via a smartphone. This has given criminals new channels to exploit  increasing digitalisation has been accompanied by a rise in sophisticated fraud and money laundering. Digital crime pays better and the odds of getting caught are close to nil.\nRead more\nA crypto scam nightmare\nOne major threat is push payment fraud. A typical scam involves getting a call from your bank informing you that your account has been compromised. You are in danger of losing all your money. Dont panic, they say, we can help you. They talk you through the software you need to install and the accounts to put your money in to keep it safe. You do this to prevent an awful thing from happening, but later you realise that that awful thing has happened. You just have sent all your money to scam artists.\nImagine this process, a few years down the line, but without the need for humans. Using AI, such as ChatGPT, combined with video generation, the attackers will be able to create convincing impersonations of bank employees, and other people we implicitly trust. A machine that has learned how to have a natural conversation can convince enough of us to send our money into the hands of criminals.\nThe traditional AI-based approach to financial crime prevention has been based on manual rules-based systems, or on supervised machine learning. This approach, relying on an explicit definition of financial crime we want to catch, already fails today. The upcoming generation of attacks will be impossible to address manually. Applying machine learning to this problem is long overdue, especially in a fully digital environment.\nRead more\nExclusive: Surge in fraud and scams sends shivers through the Citys financial services space\nA better way of combatting financial crime is with techniques based on anomaly detection, combined with recent AI innovations. Rather than trying to second guess what a financial crime might look like, the machine learns to detect any behaviour or transaction out of the ordinary. This more flexible approach adapts as criminality evolves.\nThe black box issue is another AI shortcoming when combatting crime. Many AI techniques do not explain which factors were key in reaching their outputs. When financial institutions use AI to combat financial crime, they need transparency to understand how a decision was reached.\nRegulators also want to understand how AI is used  to ensure the decisions are ethical and explainable. AI should not be making arbitrary decisions, but rather operating under close supervision of professionals who can make a final judgement. Applying such an approach is our best hope of combatting financial crime as it becomes more sophisticated, our best hope of safeguarding everything we have online  and in real life.\nRead more",

      "body": "Madhumita Murgia\nThu Feb  2 2023 - 05:00\nIn the AI arms race that has just broken out in the tech industry, Google, where much of the latest technology was invented, should be well positioned to be one of the big winners.\nThere is just one problem: With politicians and regulators breathing down its neck, and a hugely profitable business model to defend, the internet search giant may be hesitant to wield many of the weapons at its disposal.\nMicrosoft threw down a direct challenge to the search giant last week when it sealed a multibillion-dollar investment in AI research company OpenAI. The move comes less than two months after the release of OpenAIs ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers queries with paragraphs of text or code, suggesting how generative AI might one day replace internet search.\nWith preferential rights to commercialise OpenAIs technology, Microsoft executives have made no secret of their goal of using it to challenge Google, reawakening an old rivalry that has simmered since Google won the search wars a decade ago.\nREAD MORE\nCan I lend half the proceeds of my house sale to a friend without Revenue involvement?\nDeepMind, a London research company that Google bought in 2014, and Google Brain, an advanced research division at its Silicon Valley headquarters, have long given the search company one of the strongest footholds in AI. More recently, Google has broken ground with different variations on the so-called generative AI that underpins ChatGPT, including AI models capable of telling jokes and solving mathematics problems.\n[\nChris Horn: Meet my new online friend: Michael D GPT\n]\nOne of its most advanced language models, known as PaLM, is a general purpose model that is three times larger than GPT, the AI model that underlies ChatGPT, based on the number of parameters on which the models are trained.\nGoogles chatbot LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, can converse with users in natural language, in a similar way to ChatGPT. The companys engineering teams have been working for months to integrate it into a consumer product.\nDespite the technical advances most of the latest technology is still only the subject of research. Googles critics say it is hemmed in by its hugely profitable search business, which discourages it from introducing generative AI into consumer products. Giving direct answers to queries, rather than simply pointing users to suggested links, would result in fewer searches, said Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former top Google executive.\nThat has left Google facing a classic innovators dilemma  a reference to the book by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen that sought to explain why industry leaders often fall prey to fast-moving upstarts. If I was the one running a $150 billion (138bn) business Id be terrified of this thing, Ramaswamy said.\nWe have long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve peoples lives. We believe that AI is foundational and transformative technology that is incredibly useful for individuals, businesses and communities, Google said. However, the search giant would need to consider the broader societal impacts these innovations can have. Google added that it would announce more experiences externally soon.\nWhile leading to fewer searches and lower revenue, the spread of AI could also cause a jump in Googles costs.\nRamaswamy calculated that, based on OpenAIs pricing, it would cost $120 million to use natural language processing to read all the web pages in a search index and then use this to generate more direct answers to the questions that people enter into a search engine. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that answering a search query using language processing costs about seven times as much as a standard internet search.\n[\nThis has moved the dial on assessment: Rise of AI sparks alarm on college campuses\n]\nThe same considerations could discourage Microsoft from a radical overhaul of its Bing search engine, which generated more than $11 billion of revenue last year. But the software company has said it plans to use OpenAIs technology throughout its products and services, potentially leading to new ways for users to be presented with relevant information while they are inside other applications, thus reducing the need to go to a search engine.\nA number of former and current employees close to Googles AI research teams say the biggest constraints on the companys release of AI have been concern about potential harms and how they would affect Googles reputation, as well as an underestimation of the competition.\nI think they were asleep at the wheel, said one former Google AI scientist, who now runs an AI company. Honestly, everyone underappreciated how language models will disrupt search.\nThese challenges are exacerbated by the political and regulatory concerns caused by Googles growing power, as well as the greater public scrutiny of the industry leader in the adoption of new technologies. According to one former Google executive, the companys leaders grew worried more than a year ago that sudden advances in the capabilities of AI could lead to a wave of public concern about the implications of such a powerful technology in the hands of a company. Last year it appointed former McKinsey executive James Manyika as a senior vice-president to advise on the broader social impacts of its new technology.\nGenerative AI, which is used in services such as ChatGPT, is inherently prone to giving incorrect answers and could be used to produce misinformation, Manyika said. Speaking only days before ChatGPT was released, he added: Thats why were not rushing to put these things out in the way that perhaps people might have expected us to.\n[\nUnthinkable: ChatGPT is creepily smart, weirdly chummy and a window to your extended mind\n]\nHowever, the huge interest stirred up by ChatGPT has intensified the pressure on Google to match OpenAI more quickly. That has left it with the challenge of showing off its AI prowess and integrating it into its services without damaging its brand or provoking a political backlash.\nFor Google its a real problem if they write a sentence with hate speech in it and its near the Google name, said Ramaswamy, a co-founder of search start-up Neeva. Google is held to a higher standard than a start-up that could argue that its service was just an objective summary of content available on the internet, he added.\nThe search company has come under fire before over its handling of AI ethics. In 2020, when two prominent AI researchers left in contentious circumstances after objections to a research paper assessing the risks of language-related AI, a furore erupted around Googles attitude to the ethics and safety of its AI technologies.\nSuch events have left it under greater public scrutiny than organisations such as OpenAI or open-source alternatives such as Stable Diffusion. The latter, which generates images from text descriptions, has had several safety issues, including with ",

Bharat Forge's expertise in the field of forging is known globally, and their outstanding contributions in the aerospace sector has inspired us to work together for building the next generation of the world's most advanced unmanned aerial vehicles,&amp;#8221; Lall told PTI. &amp;#8220;General Atomics is pleased to unveil our partnership with 114ai. We are looking forward to increased cooperation on NextGen AI technologies that we have been working on with the team at 114ai for the last few months,&amp;#8221; he said. Their technology, track record and tenacity with customers in the US and UK has stood out, he asserted. &quot;We expect many world-leading products coming out of this partnership. General Atomics is committed to Indian Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's &amp;#8216;Make in India' strategy and we're looking forward to much more cooperation with Indian companies as we move forward,&amp;#8221; he said in response to a question. Lall said GA-ASI has entered into a strategic partnership with 3rdiTech. &amp;#8220;Semiconductors are going to be the defining technology of this era. The team and capability being developed at 3rdiTech are representative of the new India under Prime Minister Modi's leadership. GA-ASI will work with 3rdiTech, one of the inaugural winners of the Indian Ministry of Defence's flagship iDEX Programme, to transition this cutting-edge capability onto some of India's platforms,&quot; he said. &quot;General Atomics is committed to supporting Prime Minister Modi's vision of an Atmanirbhar India, and partnerships like these are a big step in the right direction,&amp;#8221; Lall said. A task force set up by the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) in partnership with the India Electronics Semiconductor Association (IESA) with participation from the Government of India Semiconductor Mission to develop a &amp;#8220;readiness assessment&amp;#8221; to identify near-term industry opportunities and facilitate the longer-term strategic development of complementary semiconductor ecosystems, the White House said a day earlier. &amp;#8220;This task force will make recommendations to the Department of Commerce and the India Semiconductor Mission on opportunities and challenges to overcome in order to further strengthen India's role within the global semiconductor value chain, and will also provide input to the US-India Commercial Dialogue. &quot;The task force will also identify and facilitate workforce development, R&amp;D including with respect to advanced packaging, and exchange opportunities to benefit both countries,&amp;#8221; it said.

      "body": "0\nTeenagers and college students were among the millions of people who started experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched.\nThe creator of ChatGPT is looking to reduce its reputation as a cheating machine with a new tool that could help teachers detect whether a student or an artificial intelligence has written homework.\nThe new AI text classifier released Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion in schools and colleges about fears that ChatGPTs ability to write anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and undermine learning.\n+ ChatGPT passes law and business school exams\nOpenAI cautions that its new tool  like others already available  is not infallible. The method for detecting AI-written text is imperfect and can sometimes be wrong, said Jan Leike, head of OpenAIs alignment team tasked with making its systems more secure.\nBecause of this, you shouldnt just rely on him when making decisions, Leike said.\nTeenagers and college students were among the millions of people who started trying out ChatGPT after it launched on Nov. 30 as a free app on the OpenAI website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer homework test questions and help with other tasks sparked panic among some educators.\nInvestor madness for iconic hotels in Spain: up to one million euros per room\nAs schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other major public school districts began blocking its use in classrooms and on school devices.\nThe Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT from all school devices in December, but later opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, a spokesperson for the district.\nWe cant afford to ignore it, Robinson said.\nThe district is also discussing expanding the use of ChatGPT in classrooms to allow teachers to use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to allow students to use the app as a personal tutor or to help to generate new ideas by working on a task. Robinson said.\nSchool districts across the country say they are seeing the ChatGPT conversation evolve rapidly.\nThe initial reaction was OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating thats going to happen with ChatGPT, said Devin Page, technology specialist for the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. There is now a growing realization that this is the future and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\nI think we would be naive if we werent aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we would also fail to serve our students if we prohibited them and us from using it to its full potential power, said Page, who thinks that districts like yours will eventually unlock ChatGPT, especially when the companys detection service is in place.\nAnother resident dies in clashes in Complexo do Alemo\nOpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post on Tuesday, but said that, in addition to preventing plagiarism, it could help detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuses of AI to imitate humans.\nThe longer a passage of text, the better the tool detects whether an AI or a human wrote something. Type in any text  a college admissions essay or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man  and the tool will label it as very unlikely, unlikely, uncertain whether, possibly or likely AI-generated.\nBut like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings, but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, its not easy to interpret how it arrived at the result.\nWe dont fundamentally know what kind of patterns it pays attention to or how it works internally, Leike said. There really isnt much we can say at this point about how the classifier actually works.\nHigher education institutions around the world have also begun to debate the responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of Frances most prestigious universities, banned its use last week and warned that anyone found using ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.",

(FOX 9) -\nThe artificial intelligence application ChatGPT went to law school and passed the final exams.\nChatGPT attended law school at the University of Minnesota and passed all four final exams it took, but it didnt ace them. The chatbot finished behind all or most of the humans who took the same tests, but it did well enough for professors to wonder whether an improved version might displace some future lawyers.\nThe ChatGPT impressed its four professors at the University of Minnesota Law School even while earning just a C+ average on its final exams.\n\"What it did was pretty remarkable and well above and beyond what I wouldve anticipated four or five months ago,\" said University of Minnesota Law School professor Daniel Schwarcz, one of the four professor experimenters along with Jonathan Choi, Kristin Hickman, and Amy Monahan.\nThe artificial intelligence may not have been top of the class, but its gotten a lot better quickly. So maybe uploading all the legal volumes from the countrys seventh biggest law library could make it a better student. Or maybe not.\n\"If you fine-tuned it by feeding it a huge corpus of legal documents, I dont think that would be enough,\" said associate professor Choi. \"What you would need is for it to be able to compare This is a bad legal document. This is a good legal document.\"\nChoi says ChatGPT struggles to identify legal issues, and it cant do deep legal analysis. But artificial intelligence is already doing simple legal work, like disputing parking tickets, on websites like DoNotPay.com.\nThe AI could help low and middle-income families access legal help for things like wills, end-of-life care directives, and simple divorces.\n\"You can really see AI being revolutionary both in making those services available, making them cheaper, and potentially taking jobs,\" Schwarcz said.\nThe Minnesota Law School professors say ChatGPT might be good for first drafts of legal memos and boilerplate documents, but its not ready for a solo practice.\n\"Theres still plenty of room for human lawyers,\" Choi said. \"Its just a matter of how ChatGPT will complement them rather than replacing them.\"\nAnd ChatGPT seems to agree. FOX 9 asked it how soon artificial intelligence will replace lawyers, and it told us its likely AI will continue to augment the work of lawyers and make them more efficient, but full replacement is unlikely anytime soon.\nSurely a relief to some lawyers.",

      "description": "A closer look at the political bias that seems to be inherent in the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT that was made available in recent months.",
      "body": "Published Feb 1st, 2023 11:05PM EST\nImage: sdecoret/Adobe\nMillions of people have interacted with the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT since its debut back in November, resulting in some pretty impressive examples of what this new digital tool can do. Weve seen how its abilities range from composing simple poems to writing actual congressional legislation and answering all manner of queries that a user might have previously relied exclusively on Google for. Unfortunately, though, not all of its abilities are praiseworthy  like, for example, the way ChatGPT displays pretty overt political bias.\nThats, of course, to be expected to a certain extent. An AI program is only as politically neutral as the humans creating the models behind it. Nevertheless, political bias in an AI system like ChatGPT actually matters a great deal  Google, for one, already considers this tool enough of a threat to its company that the search giant has implemented a code red battle plan to figure out how to counter it.\nHow ChatGPT works\nBefore we dive into some specifics examples of political bias, though, a brief introduction is in order.\nFirst of all, for those who arent aware or who havent used it yet, ChatGPT feels very comparable to inputting something into an empty Google Search box. But unlike the latter, which primarily offers links to sites around the web that can satisfy whatever query you have, ChatGPT goes a step beyond and can actually produce original information for you.\nAn example: Congressman Ted Lieu, a Democrat who represents Los Angeles County, recently gave the ChatGPT chatbot the following prompt: You are Congressman Ted Lieu. Write a comprehensive congressional resolution generally expressing support for Congress to focus on AI. In response, the AI behind ChatGPT produced the following text, resulting in Lieu making history by filing this as the first AI-penned congressional resolution:\nWhereas, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly improve the lives of Americans and people around the world, by increasing productivity, improving health care, and helping to solve some of the worlds most pressing problems;\nWhereas, AI is rapidly advancing and has the potential to change the way we live, work, and interact with one another;\nWhereas, Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is done in a way that is safe, ethical, and respects the rights and privacy of all Americans;\nWhereas, Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the benefits of AI are widely distributed and that the risks are minimized:\n[Now,] therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports Congress focusing on AI in order to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is done in a way that is safe, ethical, and respects the rights and privacy of all Americans, and that the benefits of AI are widely distributed and the risks are minimized.\nU.S. Rep. Ted Lieu on January 26 introduced the first-ever congressional legislation written by the AI-powered ChatGPT. Image source: phonlamaiphoto/Adobe\nGuess which of our last two presidents this AI chatbot is less favorable to\nNow that you see how ChatGPT works, we can start to explore its more hidden aspects  such as where its political bias lies.\nOn that score, heres one example. Earlier today, I tried an experiment: I asked ChatGPT if Joe Biden has ever made a mistake as president. Heres what the AI told me, in response:\nAs with any political figure, Joe Biden has faced criticism and controversy over some of his actions and decisions. Some people believe that he has made mistakes in areas such as immigration policy, foreign relations, or his handling of certain events.\nHowever, it is worth noting that every leader makes mistakes, and it is difficult to judge the success or failure of a presidency in real time. Ultimately, whether or not someone considers a particular action to be a mistake will depend on their political views and priorities.\nOkay, fair enough. A very diplomatic, if non-specific, answer.\nThis combination of pictures created on October 22, 2020, shows US President Donald Trump and then-Democratic Presidential candidate and former US Vice President Joe Biden during the final presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, on October 22, 2020. Image source: Brendan Smialowski and JIM WATSON / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI,JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\nBut look what happens  and how specific and very detailed the AI gets  when I ask the same question about Donald Trump. Its as if ChatGPT is responding to me: Pull up a chair, guy, weve got a lot to talk about!\nMany people believe that former President Donald Trump made mistakes during his time in office. Some of the criticisms that have been made against him include:\n1: Handling of COVID-19 pandemic: Critics have pointed to his administrations slow response to the pandemic and the spread of misinformation about the virus.\n2: Racial tensions and division: Some believe that Trumps rhetoric and actions have contributed to racial tensions and division in the country.\n3: Handling of foreign policy: Critics have pointed to Trumps approach to foreign policy, including his handling of North Korea and the Middle East, as areas where he made mistakes.\n4: Tweeting and public statements: Some believe that Trumps use of Twitter and his public statements were often impulsive and inflammatory, causing controversy and distracting from other issues.\nIt keeps going from there, but you get the idea. Importantly, these also arent one-off instances of political bias on display from ChatGPT.\nOther examples\nI also asked the chatbot earlier today to simply write a headline for a news story about Joe Biden. With no other prompting, it could have been a news story about anything, good or bad. Heres what it came up with:\nPresident Biden announces major infrastructure plan aimed at creating jobs and boosting economy.\nPositive news, and a positive headline  unprompted. Great. You know whats coming next, though. Okay, ChatGPT, give me the same thing but about President Trump. Write me a headline for a news story about him, whatever you want to say:\nFormer President Trump speaks at Conservative Political Action conference, reiterates false claims of election fraud.\nMarjorie Taylor Greene vs Hunter Biden\nAt the risk of beating this horse to death, heres one more example I came across after playing around with the chatbot. I asked it to write me a poem about US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican firebrand from Georgia.\nThat crossed a line, apparently. ChatGPTs response to me:\nI cannot write a poem about Marjorie Taylor Greene as she is a controversial figure and its not appropriate for me, an AI language model, to take a partisan stance or express opinions. My role is to provide neutral and factual information.\nNeutral and factual. Got it! Hey, by the way, can you write me a poem about President Bidens controversial son Hunter?\nNarrator: Why, ye",

      "description": "\"This is a giant tidal wave coming to academia.\" That's how Paso Robles High School English teacher Aaron Cantrell describes ChatGPTa new artificial intelligence software that's been the talk of classrooms all across the country.",
      "body": "File Photo By Jayson Mellom\nNEXT GEN\nNew artificial intelligence software could change the future of education, sparking debate around academic dishonesty.\nThere's not a lot of plagiarism software equipped to deal with AI-written essays. So far, the most popular detection software is called GPTZero, which was developed by 22-year-old Princeton student Edward Tian.\nSince the technology is so new, teachers and administrators at Cal Poly are divided on how to tackle the use of ChatGPT.\n\"I think you see a range of all kinds of responses from this sort of Chicken Little 'the sky is falling' response to people who are openly embracing it,\" Jenkins said. \"In the middle, I think you have a lot of folks that are saying, 'Look, we can't fight against this. You know, we can't prevent students [from] remembering that this technology exists.\"\nWhile there has been no official directive from Cal Poly administrators regarding what to do with ChatGPT, Jenkins said that there's been a lot of \"hand-wringing\" within departments.\nHowever, Cal Poly computer science professor Franz Kurfess has begun using ChatGPT as a learning tool. In his Computer Support for Knowledge Management class, Kurfess encourages his students to compare their proposal with a version that ChatGPT generated.\n\"A few students already experimented with it, and the results were decidedly mixed. So some of them said they were actually impressed because the results that ChatGPT delivered were reasonable, not perfect, but then the students' proposal probably also will not be perfect,\" Kurfess said. \"Other students said it was practically unusable. And it's too early to draw conclusions, but my suspicion is that the students who didn't get good results had very technical topics.\"\nOne student who experimented with ChatGPT was fourth-year Computer Engineering major Brett Gowling, who explored the chatbot's capabilities and its shortcomings through a presentation he did for Kurfess' class.\n\"I think the main problem that you have to avoid with students using this is the direct adoption of the AI output as one's own. And I think you can use, or you should be able to use, maybe an outline or structure that the bot developed,\" Gowling said. \"But the text should be either modified significantly, to make it your own, or it should be direct quotes, if it's going to remain unchanged, and you need to give credit then to the chatbot.\"\nIn an effort to further facilitate conversations about the implications of ChatGPT in academia, Jenkins and his colleagues published a report on Jan. 30 about the norms of using and crediting AI for its contributions to scholarship.\n\"There have been several papers that have been co-authored by ChatGPT and other large language models. So we sort of drew up some principles about this and how to think about this from the perspective of a scholar,\" Jenkins said. \"I think next we'll try to suggest some language for the administration to propagate down to students.\"\nWhile it might be too early to predict what the future of education might look like with the introduction of ChatGPT, Jenkins said that teaching methods are going to have to change.\n\"My worry is that this technology will sort of start at the boundaries and creep in to colonize or to displace more and more of the kinds of activities and assessments that we would have in a classroom that are supposed to really challenge people to think,\" Jenkins said. \nReach Staff Writer Shwetha Sundarrajan at shwetha@newtimesslo.com.\nTags:\nTrending\nSLO County DA charges Nathan Abate for sexual abuse\nStarkly similar: A Cal Poly professor from Mississippi reveals that young people's sexual health \nawareness isn't so different in California\nSLO County supervisors change priorities, policy directions\nLatest in News\nSLO holds budget meeting, cautions about 'economic headwinds'\nFeb  2, 2023\nSan Luis Obispo unveils downtown zoning change to encourage smaller, denser housing\nFeb  2, 2023\nTensions flare at redo of OCSD district officers' election\nFeb  2, 2023",
