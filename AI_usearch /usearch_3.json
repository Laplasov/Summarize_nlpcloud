      "body": "51% of IT decision makers believe there will be a successful cyberattack credited to ChatGPT within the year\n95% believe governments have a responsibility to regulate advanced technologies, such as ChatGPT\nBlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX : BB) today released new research revealing that half (51%) of IT professionals predict that we are less than a year away from a successful cyberattack being credited to ChatGPT and 71% believe that foreign states may already be using the technology for malicious purposes against other nations.\nThe survey of 1,500 IT decision makers across\nNorth America\n, UK, and\nAustralia\nexposed a perception that, although respondents in all countries see ChatGPT as generally being put to use for 'good' purposes, 74% acknowledge its potential threat to cybersecurity and are concerned. Though there are differing views around the world on how that threat might manifest, ChatGPT's ability to help hackers craft more believable and legitimate sounding phishing emails is the top global concern (53%), along with enabling less experienced hackers to improve their technical knowledge and develop more specialized skills (49%) and its use for spreading misinformation (49%).\nShishir Singh\n, Chief Technology Officer, Cybersecurity at BlackBerry explains: \"ChatGPT will likely increase its influence in the cyber industry over time. We've all seen a lot of hype and scaremongering, but the pulse of the industry remains fairly pragmatic  and for good reason. There are a lot of benefits to be gained from this kind of advanced technology and we're only beginning to scratch the surface, but we also can't ignore the ramifications. As the maturity of the platform and the hackers' experience of putting it to use progresses, it will get more and more difficult to defend without also using AI in defense to level the playing field.\"\nIndeed, BlackBerry's research results also revealed that the majority (82%) of IT decision-makers plan to invest in AI-driven cybersecurity in the next two years and almost half (48%) plan to invest before the end of 2023. This reflects the growing concern that signature-based protection solutions are no longer effective in providing cyber protection against an increasingly sophisticated threat.\nWhilst IT directors are positive that ChatGPT will enhance cybersecurity for businesses, the survey also revealed that 95% believe governments have a responsibility to regulate advanced technologies.  However, at present, there is an optimistic consensus that technology and research professionals will gain more than cyber criminals from the capabilities of ChatGPT.\nSingh concludes: \"It's been well documented that people with malicious intent are testing the waters but, over the course of this year, we expect to see hackers get a much better handle on how to use ChatGPT successfully for nefarious purposes; whether as a tool to write better mutable malware or as an enabler to bolster their 'skillset.' Both cyber pros and hackers will continue to look into how they can utilize it best. Time will tell who's more effective.\"\nFor more information on how BlackBerry's comprehensive, prevention-first, AI-driven cybersecurity solutions can help your business prepare for, prevent, detect and respond to cyber threats, please visit  BlackBerry.com  .\nNote:\nvehicles.

      "body": "ChatGPT has proven to be a useful tool for realtors (and possibly too useful for students). But the AI-powered chatbot is also helping people on a health level. Per MIT Technology Review, some users of ChatGPT are creating workout plans and utilizing the service as a \"proxy personal trainer.\" \n\n\n\n\"ChatGPT answers questions in seconds, saving the need to sift through tons of information,\" Rhiannon Williams writes. \"You can ask follow-up questions, too, to get a more detailed and personalized answer. Its chatty tone is ideal for dispensing fitness advice, and the information is presented clearly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the OpenAI language model is culling information from the internet, the data it's sharing related to fitness is going to be hit or miss. Williams tested out ChatGPT by asking it to create a 16-week marathon training plan. The early returns weren't promising  one suggestion from the author's prompt included running 19 miles the day before the race. (Interesting note: Even with the same user prompt, the chatbot was coming up with different answers.)\n\n\n\nWhile the marathon plan was a failure, other users of ChatGPT have utilized the tool to craft slightly less ambitious fitness plans. A fitness fanatic named Austin Goodwin was able to quickly learn about progressive overloading in weightlifting and why a calorie deficit was needed for weight loss; he described the tool as \"Google or Wikipedia search on steroidsit amplifies that and takes it to the next level.\"\n\n\n\nOther users were able to craft workable diets and fitness plans, although nobody interviewed suggested that the chatbot was a good replacement for a trainer or nutritionist. And a few TikTok users even created decent workout plans based on ChatGPT suggestions, although the main complaint seemed to be a lack of variance in exercise.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@johnyu/video/7179692226644053291\n\n\n\n\nConclusion? Most users found ChatGPT's fitness advice entertaining but not serious  and they approached the AI-crafted fitness plans with plenty of healthy skepticism.",

      "description": "Google, an AI pioneer, is leery of damaging its reputation by releasing a tool that doesn't work well, a CNBC report says.",
      "body": "Google has begun testing an AI chatbot called Apprentice Bard that's similar to ChatGPT, an online service that in many ways is more useful than Google search, CNBC reported this week.ChatGPT uses artificial intelligence technology called a large language model, trained on vast swaths of data on the internet. That type of AI model uses a mechanism called a transformer, which Google pioneered. ChatGPT's success in everything from writing software, passing exams and offering advice, in the style of the King James Bible, on removing a sandwich from a VCR has propelled it into the tech spotlight, even though its results can be misleading or wrong.Google's Apprentice Bard tool is similar to ChatGPT, but the company also is testing a question-and-answer format for Google search results, CNBC said. Google Research leader Jeff Dean told employees in a 2022 meeting that Google is being more conservative with its approach to avoid \"reputational risk\" of AI that offers bad responses.Google didn't comment on the specifics of the report, but spokesperson Lily Lin said in a statement, \"We have long been focused on developing and deploying AI to improve people's lives ... We continue to test our AI technology internally to make sure it's helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.\"AI technology already is all around us, helping in everything from flagging credit card fraud to translating our speech into text messages. The ChatGPT technology has elevated expectations, though, so it's clear the technology will become more important in our lives one way or another as we rely on digital assistants and online tools.Google AI subsidiary DeepMind also is involved. Chief Executive Demis Hassabis told Time that his company is considering a 2023 private beta test of an AI chatbot called Sparrow.Google, which endured bad publicity over the departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru in 2020, has a program focusing on responsible AI and machine learning, or ML, technology. \"Building ML models and products in a responsible and ethical manner is both our core focus and core commitment,\" Google Research Vice President Marian Croak said in a January post.Google is keen to tout its deep AI expertise. ChatGPT triggered a \"code red\" emergency within Google, according toThe New York Times, and drew Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin back into active work.Editors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to create some personal finance explainers that are edited and fact-checked by our editors.

New York City school officials started blocking this week the impressive but controversial writing tool that can generate paragraphs of human-like text. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan)\nW\nriting is hard and time consuming. Thanks to ChatGPT, it just became easier and faster. Rudimentary chatbots have been writing simple articles, such as sports game summaries, for years. ChatGPT, from artificial intelligence (AI) supernova OpenAI, leaps far beyond this through its search of billions of internet texts and ability to generate passable prose from prompts and questions. It can even simulate software code. But its a large language model (LLM), so its still not great at math or many other things. It makes funny mistakes.\nBut its powerful enough to begin transforming dozens of tasks and businesses. And it doesnt need to be perfect to be the source of unimaginable mischief too.\nWell begin with the good news. Joel Mokyrs book\nThe Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress\nsprings to mind. Just as computers augmented many human capabilities, leading to boundless new products and even industries, ChatGPT can augment an even more human activitywriting. The quantity of text will explode. But will the quality of textand of the embedded ideasfollow?\nThats a bigger question.\nMark P. Mills calls it useful computing and notes the computer power dedicated to training AI models has grown 300,000-fold per year over the past six years. However, the idea that AI is approaching human-level general intelligence is wrong for many reasons; among them is its voracious consumption of energy and space compared to the elegant efficiency of the human brain.\nBehind the scenes, ChatGPT is based on fancy pattern-matching math. But its also a new user interface, which might subsume large portions of the functions of Amazons Alexa, Apples Siri, and Googles Search, thus expanding and democratizing the world of search. Search not only helps us learn. Its also augmented our memory massively, expanding our lowly biological data storage. But ChatGPTs search plus can also amplify and democratize human output.\nRegular people will get access to previously arcane tools. WolframAlpha has already highlighted the path to turning language into math. As Andrej Karpathy says, The hottest new programming language is English.\nChatGPT will amplify machine output too. Lots of ink has been spilled, yet again, about the jobs ChatGPT will render obsolete. Teams are already replacing the back end of software stacks with LLMs. ChatGPT can turn unstructured data into structured data (i.e., create a database from a data jumble).\nBut used creatively, ChatGPT could benefit nearly anyone and be a central component of a new productivity boom. It might debug software for coders. Researchers can become exponentially more productive. Writers and managers can generate new ideas and outlines, allowing them to focus on what they do best. It can off-load busy paperwork. People who dont like to write but who have other amazing talentsin art, mechanics, sports, or salescan now turn their ideas and personalities into written output.\nNow for the bad news.Such a powerful and versatile tool will also amplify harmful things, including both disinformation and censorship. Marc Andreessen, as usual,\nis correct\n: The censorship pressure applied to social media over the last decade pales in comparison to the censorship pressure that will be applied to AI.\nThink about todays chief sources of disinformation, dispensed at even greater speeds globally. Then turn these falsities into millions of articles, video clips, tweets, and TikToks. Now you dont need human trolls to amplify propaganda. The entire process is automated.\nThe time and energy required to police these bots will also increase, and Elon Musks Twitter 2.0 is already on the job. GPTZero is a new tool that sniffs out AI-based text. Anti-spam counter-technologies will arise to rebut the erroneous material.\nAnother potential danger of the ChatGPT era will be the amplification of an already dangerous trend: the abandonmentindeed, often the abolitionof human judgment.\nSome of AIs great contributions may, for example, come in health care. But only if we allow physicians, patients, scientists, and entrepreneurs to use AI as they see fit.\nA tragedy of the COVID era was the top-down, one-size-fits-all, medicine-by-decree, which discouraged experimentation, learning, and individual risk-reward calculations. It leveraged the imperious relationship of Medicare and giant health systems over individual doctors and patients. It accelerated the sad decline of doctors into mere box checkers employing protocols written by politicized medical associations.\nThe rise of AI must thus be met with new rights and institutions that ensure it is a decentralizing force, as opposed to a consolidator of power. Who programs the AI? Which information is the AI allowed to consider?\nOpenAI founder Sam Altman\nsays it well\n:\nYou should be able to write up a few pages of heres what I want, here are my values, heres how I want the AI to behave, and it reads it and thinks about it and acts exactly how you want, because it should be your AI.\nWill Altman follow his wise words with action?\nThis article originally appeared in the\nAEIdeas\nblog and is reprinted with kind permission from the American Enterprise Institute\n.",

      "description": "A Twitch channel called watchmeforever is streaming an artificial intelligence generated version of Seinfeld online. The infinite stream has already found viral success.",
      "body": "Watchmeforever\nIn a twist of technology that only 30 Rock could have predicted, an AI-generated version of Seinfeld is now taking over Twitch. The stream, hosted by a channel called watchmeforever, uses generative artificial intelligence to create an infinite stream of Seinfeld-esque content online. The novel idea has taken root on the platform, and at time of publication, the stream has roughly 15,400 concurrent viewers.\nThe content comes at a time when generative AI seems to be cropping up everywhere. Heres what you need to know about AI Seinfeld on Twitch.\nWhat is AI Seinfeld?\nAI Seinfeld is a Twitch stream that plays AI-generated content based on Jerry Seinfeld and Larry Davids 90s comedic sitcom, Seinfeld. The characters are rendered with chunky 3D pixels, and look like they are in a video game version of the show. The voices are AI generated as well, and while they do bear some similarities with the original actors voices, they ultimately sound more like an auto-reader on a computer.\nThis AI-generated version of Seinfeld doesnt really compare to the original, but you can definitely see the influence of the original show in snippets of this version. In one part of the stream I watched, the characters started talking about creating a place where they could make their own pizza crust, which appears to be connected to a bit in Seinfeld where Kramer gets a business idea to open a pizzeria where guests make their own pizzas.\nOne popular clip actually has decent dialogue. Its titled, Elaine goes out with a guy who hates fruit. In it, Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and George wander around Jerrys apartment and talk about Elaines boyfriend who hates fruit and might be a fruit-a-phobe. However, the AI generation isnt able to mimic the color and delivery of the actors, and it can be very difficult to tell who is saying what at points. You can view in the clip below.\nWho is making the AI Seinfeld show?\nThe group making it is called Mismatch Media, and the people behind it describe themselves as scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers, technology professionals, and more, on their website. Otherwise, the group appears somewhat reclusive, and its not clear who are the actual people behind the stream.\nThe group takes a rather pessimistic tone to the content it creates. On the Twitch page, a description of the stream reads, Nothing, Forever is a show about nothing, that happens forever. Kinda like popular sitcoms of the past, except that it never stops. The channel description promises to run 365 days a year and deliver new content every minute.\nPolygon has reached out to Mismatch Media for comment, and will update the article if we receive a response.\nWhy are people watching the AI Seinfeld show?\nSeinfeld is one of the most beloved and recognizable sitcoms of the past few decades, but the appeal goes beyond that. Viewing the AI generated show on Twitch allows people to partake in a unique online communal experience that can feel like live television, as people watch the characters act and react to the various scenarios in the world. Additionally, we get to watch and participate in the Twitch chat, which makes it more fun. (Like, yes, please spam the chat with the KomodoHype each time a character complains about a girlfriend or boyfriend.)\nThe stream also shows off what generative AI is capable of. Its one in a long series of recently popular AI applications. ChatGPT, which can be used for a variety of applications like writing essays, became an overnight sensation due to its natural-language output. Other software like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Free AI Art Generator is being used to create memes and recreate the look of certain directors films. AI Seinfeld is just the next cursed step in the evolution of consumer AI.\nSign up for the                  newsletter\nPatch Notes",

      "body": "AI-generated Seinfeld turns the show about nothing into nightmare fuel\nThis is what AI should be used for.\nChristian Harrison\nScreengrab via watchmeforever on Twitch\nAI programs have been in the news a lot lately, whether its because of the fear they will replace the work of creatives or that there is a whole service dedicated to talking to historical figures using ChatGPT. However, the more you mess around with them, the more you realize how far AI still has to go. There is no better example of this than the current AI-generated Seinfeld show that goes on forever.\nThe channel, called watchmeforever, uses AI to write, voice, and animate an infinite version of the classic 90s TV show. The show largely takes place in three different rooms representing two of the apartments from the show and the comedy club that Jerry is seen at as cold opens in the show. As with past AI creations, it often falls into shambles pretty quickly, and much of what happens ranges from being kind of funny to off-the-wall strange.\nMuch of it is typical stuff youve heard from AI chatbots before. Its the same as those videos where someone will put two AI together and record their conversations. They sometimes have decent back and forth, but it also kind of rambles at times which gives the practice an uneasy vibe. Whats even worse is when the character models on the sets behave erratically during long periods of silence.\nUsers have begun to post clips across Twitter showing various moments from the stream, including the one below where Larry (Jerry), Yvonne (Elaine), and Fred (George) seemingly become self-aware and a little nihilistic at times. Luckily, Larry comes in at the end with some hope before very slowly reclining in a chair as the scene ends.\nthe Seinfeld AI is becoming self-aware this is not a drill\nFebruary 2, 2023\nAnother example of Larry providing hope is when it appears Fred is spiraling into an existential crisis while staring at the fridge. He ponders whether there is something after life or if thats the end of it. Larry provides a short monologue about whats possible and the hope humans hold for something bigger. It almost feels genuine and inspiring, even if its something thats a bit of a cliche.\nIt would honestly really be inspiring if Fred wasnt doing the weirdest thing possible in the background right before Larry starts vibrating at a high frequency.\nI WAS WATCHING THE INFINITE AI GENERATED SEINFELD STREAM AND WHAT THE FUCK LMAO",

The date of the climate apocalypse cannot be precisely determined because it depends on our carbon dioxide emissions and climate protection measures.\nIf we dont act, according to experts, climate catastrophe could occur by the end of the 21st century or the beginning of the 22nd century.\nBut disaster can be averted if urgent measures are taken.\nQuestion: Which regions of Earth are most likely to survive the climate apocalypse?\nChatGPT: The effects of the climate apocalypse will affect different regions of the world to varying degrees, and each region will bear these effects to a different degree.  However\nIndex - Abroad - The EU has decided: Buyer is good, Apple is good\nNo region is completely protected from the effects of climate apocalypse.\nThe climate apocalypse has a negative impact on quality of life everywhere, and in most cases, climate change-related events such as extreme weather, water scarcity, reduced food production and health problems, as well as social instability are significantly reduced.  Life.  Regions that are less sensitive to the effects of climate change and that have financial resources for climate protection measures are more likely to survive the climate apocalypse.\nQuestion: Which countries are safe in terms of climate apocalypse?  Please write a list.\nChatGPT: No country is completely protected from the effects of climate disaster because climate disaster is a global phenomenon and affects all countries.  However, there are countries that are better prepared to deal with the consequences of the climate apocalypse:\nNorway\nLuxembourg\nRepublic of Che\nThese countries are considered advanced in terms of climate protection, eco-friendly technologies and energy efficiency, and are taking comprehensive measures to combat climate change.  However, it is also important to note that all countries must continue to do something to combat climate catastrophe and move towards sustainable development.\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nAt the end of November 2022, OpenAIs language model supported by artificial intelligence, ChatGPT 3.5, became available, which represents a revolutionary development, as the chatbot, in addition to answering simple questions, performs complex tasks such as writing poetry and programming.\nGPT 3.5 was trained on Microsofts Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.  A reinforcement learning method based on human perception, i.e. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Perception) was used to improve the language model.\nThe success of OpenAI and ChatGPT has also attracted the attention of competitors, and Google may soon introduce a beta version of its artificial intelligence called Sparrow to challenge ChatGPT.\nWhat are the weaknesses of ChatGPT?\nChatGPT often makes false or impossible statements that appear true at first.  There could be many reasons for this, for example, because the chatbot does not have an active connection to the Internet, the information you are looking for during model training is not yet available.\nThe chatbot is trained on databases from the web, so despite all precautions, it can easily pick up stereotypes and biases in practice.  This is evident from the fact that at times he responds to certain questions with generalized comments and generic jokes.  The model generally rejects some claims that it deems dangerous, but it may provide harmful mechanisms or provide biased answers to some questions.\nDigital Transformation 2023\nA miss misses!

      "body": "ChatGPT: The Promises, Pitfalls and Panic\nFebruary 2, 2023\nVoicered\nExcitement around ChatGPT  an easy to use AI chatbot that can deliver an essay or computer code upon request and within seconds  has sent schools into panic and turned Big Tech green with envy.\nThe potential impact of ChatGPT on society remains complicated and unclear even as its creator Wednesday announced a paid subscription version in the United States.\nHere is a closer look at what ChatGPT is (and is not):\nIs this a turning point?\nIt is entirely possible that Novembers release of ChatGPT by California company OpenAI will be remembered as a turning point in introducing a new wave of artificial intelligence to the wider public.\nWhat is less clear is whether ChatGPT is actually a breakthrough with some critics calling it a brilliant PR move that helped OpenAI score billions of dollars in investments from Microsoft.\nYann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta and professor at New York University, believes ChatGPT is not a particularly interesting scientific advance, calling the app a flashy demo built by talented engineers.\nLeCun, speaking to the Big Technology Podcast, said ChatGPT is void of any internal model of the world and is merely churning one word after another based on inputs and patterns found on the internet.\nWhen working with these AI models, you have to remember that theyre slot machines, not calculators, warned Haomiao Huang of Kleiner Perkins, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\nEvery time you ask a question and pull the arm, you get an answer that could be marvelous or not The failures can be extremely unpredictable, Huang wrote in Ars Technica, the tech news website.\nJust like Google\nChatGPT is powered by an AI language model that is nearly three years old  OpenAIs GPT-3  and the chatbot only uses a part of its capability.\nThe true revolution is the humanlike chat, said Jason Davis, research professor at Syracuse University.\nIts familiar, its conversational and guess what? Its kind of like putting in a Google search request, he said.\nChatGPTs rockstar-like success even shocked its creators at OpenAI, which received billions in new financing from Microsoft in January.\nGiven the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview to StrictlyVC, a newsletter.\nWe put GPT-3 out almost three years ago so the incremental update from that to ChatGPT, I felt like should have been predictable and I want to do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that, he said.\nThe risk, Altman added, was startling the public and policymakers and on Tuesday his company unveiled a tool for detecting text generated by AI amid concerns from teachers that students may rely on artificial intelligence to do their homework.\nWhat now?\nFrom lawyers to speechwriters, from coders to journalists, everyone is waiting breathlessly to feel disruption caused by ChatGPT. OpenAI just launched a paid version of the chatbot  $20 per month for an improved and faster service.\nFor now, officially, the first significant application of OpenAIs tech will be for Microsoft software products.\nThough details are scarce, most assume that ChatGPT-like capabilities will turn up on the Bing search engine and in the Office suite.\nThink about Microsoft Word. I dont have to write an essay or an article, I just have to tell Microsoft Word what I wanted to write with a prompt, said Davis.\nHe believes influencers on TikTok and Twitter will be the earliest adopters of this so-called generative AI since going viral requires huge amounts of content and ChatGPT can take care of that in no time.\nThis of course raises the specter of disinformation and spamming carried out at an industrial scale.\nFor now, Davis said the reach of ChatGPT is very limited by computing power, but once this is ramped up, the opportunities and potential dangers will grow exponentially.\nAnd much like the ever imminent arrival of self-driving cars that never quite happens, experts disagree on whether that is a question of months or years.\nRidicule\nLeCun said Meta and Google have refrained from releasing AI as potent as ChatGPT out of fear of ridicule and backlash.\nQuieter releases of language-based bots  like Metas Blenderbot or Microsofts Tay for example  were quickly shown capable of generating racist or inappropriate content.\nTech giants have to think hard before releasing something that is going to spew nonsense and disappoint, he said.",

      "description": "The initial goal of AI was to create machines that think like humans. But that is not what happened at all.",
      "body": "Copy a link to the article entitled http://What%20kind%20of%20intelligence%20is%20artificial%20intelligence?\nShare What kind of intelligence is artificial intelligence? on Facebook\nShare What kind of intelligence is artificial intelligence? on LinkedIn\nChatGPT is basically auto-complete on steroids.\nI heard that quip from a computer scientist at the University of Rochester as my fellow professors and I attended a workshop on the new reality of artificial intelligence in the classroom. Like everyone else, we were trying to grapple with the astonishing capacities of ChatGPT and its AI-driven ability to write student research papers, complete computer code, and even compose that bane of every professors existence, the university strategic planning document.\nThat computer scientists remark drove home a critical point. If we really want to understand artificial intelligences power, promise, and peril, we first need to understand the difference between intelligence as it is generally understood and the kind of intelligence we are building now with AI. That is important, because the kind we are building now is really the only kind we know how to build at all  and it is nothing like our own intelligence.\nThe gap in AI delivery\nThe term artificial intelligence dates back to the 1950s, when electronic computers were first being built, and it emerged during a 1956 meeting at Dartmouth College. It was there that a group of scientists laid the groundwork for a new project whose goal was a computer that could think. As the proposal for the meeting put it, the field of artificial intelligence believed that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\nThrough much of the fields early years, AI researchers tried to understand how thinking happened in humans, then use this understanding to emulate it in machines. This meant exploring how the human mind reasons or builds abstractions from its experience of the world. An important focus was natural language recognition, meaning the ability for a computer to understand words and their combinations (syntax, grammar, and meaning), allowing them to interact naturally with humans.\nOver the years, AI went through cycles of optimism and pessimism  these have been called AI summers and winters  as remarkable periods of progress stalled out for a decade or more. Now we are clearly in an AI summer. A combination of mind-boggling computing power and algorithmic advances combined to bring us a tool like ChatGPT. But if we look back, we can see a considerable gap between what many hoped AI would mean and the kind of artificial intelligence that has been delivered. And that brings us back to the autocomplete on steroids comment.\nModern versions of AI are based on what is called machine learning. These are algorithms that use sophisticated statistical methods to build associations based on some training set of data fed to them by humans. If you have ever solved one of those reCAPTCHA find the crosswalk tests, you have helped create and train some machine learning program. Machine learning sometimes involves deep learning, where algorithms represent stacked layers of networks, each one working on a different aspect of building the associations.\nMachine learning in all its forms represents a stunning achievement for computer science. We are just beginning to understand its reach. But the important thing to note is that its basis rests on a statistical model. By feeding the algorithms enormous amounts of data, the AI we have built is based on curve fitting in some hyperdimensional space  each dimension comprises a parameter defining the data. By exploring these vast data spaces, machines can, for example, find all the ways a specific word might follow a sentence that begins with, It was a dark and stormy\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday\nIn this way our AI wonder-machines are really prediction machines whose prowess comes out of the statistics gleaned from the training sets. (While I am oversimplifying the wide range of machine learning algorithms, the gist here is correct.) This view does not diminish in any way the achievements of the AI community, but it underscores how little this kind of intelligence (if it should be\n) resembles our intelligence.\nIntelligence is not opaque\nHuman minds are so much more than prediction machines. As Judea Pearl has pointed out, what really makes human beings so potent is our ability to discern causes. We do not just apply past circumstances to our current circumstance  we can reason about the causes that lay behind the past circumstance and generalize it to any new situation. It is this flexibility that makes our intelligence general and leaves the prediction machines of machine learning looking like they are narrowly focused, brittle, and prone to dangerous mistakes. ChatGPT will be happy to give you made-up references in your research paper or write news stories full of mistakes.Self-driving cars, meanwhile, continue to be a long and deadly way from full autonomy. There is no guarantee they will reach it.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of machine learning is how opaque it can be. Often it is not clear at all why the algorithms make the decisions they do, even if those decisions turn out to solve the problems the machines were tasked with. This occurs because machine learning methods rely on blind explorations of the statistical distinctions between, say, useful email and spam that live in some vast database of emails. But the kind of reasoning we use to solve a problem usually involves a logic of association that can be clearly explained. Human reasoning and human experience are never blind.\nThat difference is the difference that matters. Early AI researchers hoped to build machines that emulated the human mind. They hoped to build machines that thought like people. That is not what happened. Instead, we have learned to build machines that dont really reason at all. They associate, and that is very different. That difference is why approaches rooted in machine learning never produce the kind of General Artificial Intelligence the founders of the field were hoping for. It may also be why the greatest danger from AI wont be a machine that wakes up, becomes self-conscious, and then decides to enslave us. Instead, by misidentifying what we have built as actual intelligence, we pose the real danger to ourselves. By building these systems into our society in ways we cannot escape, we may force ourselves to conform to what they can do, rather than discover what we are capable of.\nMachine learning is coming of age, and it is a remarkable and even beautiful thing. But we should not mistake it for intelligence, lest we fail to understand our own.\nTags",

      "body": "Jerry Seinfeld, trapped in algorithmically generated limbo\nScreenshot: Watchmeforever\nSeinfeld was famously described as \"a show about nothing,\" and that description has become something of a prophecy, as a bizarre, AI-generated Seinfeld episode has been streaming on Twitch for a full month, titled Infinite Nothing.\nThe never-ending episode is, as its title suggests, very much about nothing, as algorithmically animated Seinfeld characters wander aimlessly around their apartment, engaging in meandering, dreamlike conversations powered by OpenAIs GPT-3 language model, with minimal human moderation.\nIn an interview with Vice, Skyler Hartle, the co-creator of Nothing, Forever, explained the thinking behind the project:\nThe actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project, Hartle said. But then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.\nMORE FOR YOU\nDoug Hyde, Master Of Stone, At Desert Caballeros Western Museum\nAside from the artwork and the laugh track you'll hear, everything else is generative, including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music, one of the creators wrote in a Reddit comment.\nThe result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AIs clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone.\nThe stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfelds stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, theyre not that far removed from Jerry Seinfelds limp one-liners).\nAs an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.\nAfter watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isnt coming for their jobs, yet. The AI is absolutely incapable of writing witticisms, but it is inadvertently hilarious.\nThe AI-generated animation results in characters flailing around wildly, staring at walls and walking away while speaking to one another; its like watching a group of Sims spiral into collective insanity.\nDuring my watch, Elaine told the gang about a near miss she had, after almost being hit by a guy on a bike. She went on to explain that the man wasnt actually riding the bike, but pushing it down the street like a puppy.\nThis delightfully unhinged anecdote was followed by an awkward silence. Then, Kramer stood up, unprompted, and said to the gang, Sounds like a plan. Lets go.\nNo one moved.",

When you get to the trading floor, however, some of that luster tends to go away. A risk analysis report on AI in EU securities markets by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has investigated the various ways in which AI is used in trading and more often than not it's kind of underwhelming.\nPortfolio managers are doing just fine without it\nWhen AI is used by portfolio managers at quant funds, the report claims it's \"mostly as a tool to execute specific tasks that leverage large amounts of data.\" The ability to extract and analyze data with minimal human interaction is \"driving AI adoption.\" Natural language processing in particular is one of the more popular techniques implemented.\nIf it sounds exciting, it's not really - yet. ESMA concludes that, \"AI does not seem to be transforming portfolio managers' investment practices in a disruptive or revolutionary fashion.\" It adds that machine learning isn't yet an obvious way to improve fund performance.\nThis is in part due to the fact that \"many of the AI models currently in use [are] better suited for short-term frameworks rather than long term decision-making\" as \"structural breaks in time series\" limit its ability to effectively forecast.\nYou won't be put working for elite funds...\nA peculiar finding is just how few investment funds are open about their AI use. The ESMA report screened documents from over 22,000 funds for published uses of the phrases \"artificial intelligence\" and \"machine learning\" only to find just 65 funds from 40 different fund management companies indicating the use of AI in investment strategies.\n...Because results are mixed\nWhen ESMA looked at the performance of AI funds compared to others in the market, results were neither terrible nor spectacular. Returns, interestingly, were up, though merely by 0.04%, while the total expense ratio (TER) was down 0.1%.\nWith the newness and uncertainty of AI in this space, most investors will be more inclined to trust the established investment techniques.\nThe 'next big thing' in AI won't change much\nThe biggest issue for AI in finance currently is the issue of explainability. The report claims that \"industry executives were unanimous in stating that AI is not tantamount to autonomous decision-making without human oversight.\"\nEnter, XAI. - 'Explainable artificial intelligence.' For AI to be viable, investors need to understand what's going on inside the black box. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done, and explainable AI models tend to be more limited than their opaque counterparts.\nIt works well in live trades... by doing the dirty work\nAI may not be a game changer in terms of finding investments, but it has a lot of great uses when it comes to actually executing trades. It's a shame, however, that those \"great uses\" are predominantly the work done in the background.\nWhen machine learning is implemented in pre-trade analysis, the report claims it's primarily used for \"liquid instruments for which plentiful and timely data is available\" (spot FX, equities, for example). When used outside those parameters, it's either employed as a means of reducing the market impact of trades or to feed brokers client data in order to optimize their price rates accordingly.\nTrade execution is therefore where the report says \"AI finds some of its most promising applications.\" The machine learning models used by brokers and buy-side investors here are used \"to split and execute metaorders optimally across different trading venues and times,\" in an effort to minimize market impact again.\nPost trade processing has also seen developments where ML methods are used \"to predict the probability of a trade not being settled given the resources allocated to it, so as to optimally distribute said resources.\" Another use there is for \"anomaly detection, data verification, data quality checks and automated data extraction from unstructured documents.\" Not exactly the glitz and glamour of cushy research roles at AI companies.",

WIT Studio, which produced hit series including \"Attack On Titan\" and \"Vinland Saga,\" also collaborated  an eerie sign of anime heavyweights flirting with the technology.\nWatch the promotional video, and there's definitely an ominous undertone to cutesy, sappy bullshit like this being used to show off an AI image generator that the company more or less tacitly admitted took someone's job. Sorry, but not even an adorable dog and a wide-eyed anime boy cycling through dreamlike arrays of sakuras will help let this stuff slide.\nAnd if you manage to suffer through the whole thing and reach the end, that's when Netflix really rubs the AI in. It shows an example background that started off as a hand-drawn layout. Then, through two different stages, it gets touched up via AI generation, before being manually revised in the final stage. To be perfectly frank, it looks like garbled trash.\nBut the most insulting cherry on top is that the credits list the background designer as simply \"AI (+Human).\"\nAs\nVice\nnotes, claims of a \"labor shortage\" are dubious at best. The anime industry in Japan is notorious for its demanding, stress-inducing (\nand sometimes deadly\n) schedule and insultingly poor pay, earning as little as $200 per month. Even some top animators take home less than $3,800 a month, despite anime's ludicrous earnings and popularity.\nThe reality is that there's no shortage of willing animators, but a shortage of those willing to toil under such miserable conditions.

      "body": "Paging Dr. AI? What ChatGPT and artificial intelligence could mean for the future of medicine\nVitor Miranda - stock.adobe.com\nThe tool\nBy Jen Christensen, CNN\nWithout cracking a single textbook, without spending a day in medical school, the co-author of a preprint\nstudy\ncorrectly answered enough practice questions that it would have passed the real US Medical Licensing Examination.\nBut the test-taker wasnt a member of Mensa or a medical savant; it was the artificial intelligence ChatGPT.\nThe tool, which was created to answer user questions in a conversational manner, has generated so much buzz that doctors and scientists are trying to determine what its limitations are  and what it could do for health and medicine.\nWhat ChatGPT is and isnt\nChatGPT, or Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a natural language-processing tool driven by artificial intelligence.\nThe technology, created by San Francisco-based OpenAI and launched in November, is not like a well-spoken search engine. It isnt even connected to the internet. Rather, a human programmer feeds it a vast amount of online data thats kept on a server.\nIt can answer questions even if it has never seen a particular sequence of words before, because ChatGPTs algorithm is trained to predict what word will come up in a sentence based on the context of what comes before it. It draws on knowledge stored on its server to generate its response.\nChatGPT can also answer followup questions, admit mistakes and reject inappropriate questions, the company says. Its free to try while its makers are testing it.\nMedical interest is strong\nArtificial intelligence programs have been around for a while, but this one generated so much interest that medical practices, professional associations and medical journals have created task forces to see how it might be useful and to understand what limitations and ethical concerns it may bring.\nDr. Victor Tsengs practice, Ansible Health, has set up a task force on the issue. The pulmonologist is a medical director of the California-based group and a co-author of the study in which ChatGPT demonstrated that it could probably pass the medical licensing exam.\nTseng said his colleagues started playing around with ChatGPT last year and were intrigued when it accurately diagnosed pretend patients in hypothetical scenarios.\nWe were just so impressed and truly flabbergasted by the eloquence and sort of fluidity of its response that we decided that we should actually bring this into our formal evaluation process and start testing it against the benchmark for medical knowledge, he said.\nThat benchmark was the three-part test that US med school graduates have to pass to be licensed to practice medicine. Its generally considered one of the toughest of any profession because it doesnt ask straightforward questions with answers that can easily found on the internet.\nThe exam tests basic science and medical knowledge and case management, but it also assesses clinical reasoning, ethics, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\nThe study team used 305 publicly available test questions from the June 2022 sample exam. None of the answers or related context was indexed on Google before January 1, 2022, so they would not be a part of the information on which ChatGPT trained. The study authors removed sample questions that had visuals and graphs, and they started a new chat session for each question they asked.\nStudents often spend hundreds of hours preparing, and medical schools typically give them time away from class just for that purpose. ChatGPT had to do none of that prep work.\nThe AI performed at or near passing for all the parts of the exam without any specialized training, showing a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations, the study says.\nTseng was impressed.\nTheres a lot of red herrings, he said. Googling or trying to even intuitively figure out with an open-book approach is very difficult. It might take hours to answer one question that way. But ChatGPT was able to give an accurate answer about 60% of the time with cogent explanations within five seconds.\nDr. Alex Mechaber, vice president of the US Medical Licensing Examination at the National Board of Medical Examiners, said ChatGPTs passing results didnt surprise him.\nThe input material is really largely representative of medical knowledge and the type of multiple-choice questions which AI is most likely to be successful with, he said.\nMechaber said the board is also testing ChatGPT with the exam. The members are especially interested in the answers the technology got wrong, and they want to understand why.\nI think this technology is really exciting, he said. We were also pretty aware and vigilant about the risks that large language models bring in terms of the potential for misinformation, and also potentially having harmful stereotypes and bias.\nHe believes that there is potential with the technology.\nI think its going to get better and better, and we are excited and want to figure out how do we embrace it and use it in the right ways, he said.\nOther medical possibilities\nAlready, ChatGPT has entered the discussion around research and publishing.\nThe results of the medical licensing exam study were even written up with the help of ChatGPT. The technology was originally listed as a co-author of the draft, but Tseng says that when the study is published in the journal PLOS Digital Health this year, ChatGPT will not be listed as an author because it would be a distraction.\nLast month, the journal\nNature\ncreated guidelines that said no such program could be credited as an author because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility.\nBut an article published Thursday in the journal Radiology was written almost entirely by ChatGPT. It was asked whether it could replace a human medical writer, and the program listed many of its possible uses, including writing study reports, creating documents that patients will read and translating medical information into a variety of languages.\nStill, it does have some limitations.\nI think it definitely is going to help, but everything in AI needs guardrails, said Dr. Linda Moy, the editor of Radiology and a professor of radiology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.\nShe said ChatGPTs article was pretty accurate, but it made up some references.\nOne of Moys other concerns is that the AI could fabricate data. Its only as good as the information its fed, and with so much inaccurate information available online about things like Covid-19 vaccines, it could use that to generate inaccurate results.\nMoys colleague Artie Shen, a graduating\nPh.D. candidate\nat NYUs Center for Data Science, is exploring ChatGPTs potential as a kind of translator for other AI programs for medical imaging analysis. For years, scientists have studied AI programs from startups and larger operations, like Google, that can recognize complex patterns in imaging ",

The OTT giant is getting slammed for the move on social media.\nAgencies\nThe world seems to have been smitten with AI-generated work but it seems to have not worked out well for Netflix Japan.\nNetflix has used AI-generated artwork in anime, 'The Dog & The Boy'. The move seems to have not gone down well with netizens as the company claimed to have gone for it, citing labour shortages in the anime industry.\nNetflix Japan claimed on Twitter that the makers of the anime have used AI-generated artwork as there was a shortage of labour in the industry. The streaming platform in Japan is facing immense criticism over the development.\nNetflix, in a tweet, posted that as an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which is facing a labour shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images in all three-minute video cuts!\nPeople on social media are not happy with the OTT giants justification. The move has led to immense criticism on the internet from artists as well.\nThe streaming platform has been slammed by many users, who claimed that it was trying to avoid paying human artists and justified the move by saying that there is a shortage of talent, as per media reports.\nBest Family Movies On Netflix This February\nAutoplay\nBest Family Movies On Netflix This February\nHunt For The Wilderpeople\nDirected by Taika Waititi, the emotional drama follows the unusual pair of young Ricky and his grandfather when they start spending time together to help out on a farm.\nThe Willoughbys\nThe acclaimed animated movie featuring Will Forte and Maya Rudolph, follows the story of a group of siblings who are deprived of love, care and attention and set a plan to send their parents on a deadly vacation.\nHilda And The Mountain King\nThe sequel starts just where the second series ends.

The commission was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957 as an independent, bipartisan federal fact-finding agency.\nSign up for the FOX61 newsletters:Morning Forecast, Morning Headlines, Evening Headlines\nSupporters of using algorithms say they make government systems more thorough and efficient through the use of data.\nThe Connecticut advisory committee is urging state lawmakers to pass laws that would require independent audits of algorithms, including assessments of potential biases, and mandate under state records laws that information about agencies' use of algorithms be publicly available.\nDemocratic Gov. Ned Lamont's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Democratic leaders in the legislature said they were looking into the issue. Democrats control both chambers of the General Assembly.\nSenate Republican Leader Kevin Kelly and House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora welcomed a review of how the state uses algorithms.\nPeople might be surprised to realize that its not human beings behind a desk that are making some of these decisions, but it could be computer generated, Candelora said. We need to know what goes into those programs that are making those decisions, because I believe it impacts policy.\nThe Connecticut advisory panel pointed to a\nYale Law School report\nreleased last year that said certain Connecticut agencies did not release full information about their use of algorithms in response to its requests under the state's Freedom of Information Act.\nResponses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests confirmed both that existing disclosure requirements are insufficient to allow meaningful public oversight of the use of algorithms, and that agencies do not adequately assess the effectiveness and reliability of algorithms, the report said.\nThe FOIA responses generally revealed that agencies are insufficiently aware of the potential problems posed by their algorithms and unconcerned about the lack of transparency, it said.\nThe law school said it requested information on algorithms from the state departments of Children and Families, Education and Administrative Services.\nThe Department of Children and Families provided the only complete FOIA response to the law school on the use of algorithms to identify at-risk children, the law school said. The agency disclosed basic information but not its source code, which the agency said it did not have and asserted was protected as a trade secret, the law school said.\nThe Education Department produced only partial information about an algorithm it uses to assign students to schools, while the Department of Administrative Services provided no information on an algorithm used to hire state employees and contractors, according to the law school.\nAsked about the advisory panel's recommendations and the Yale study, a spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families said it was reviewing the matters. The Department of Administrative Services said it was working on a response, and officials at the Department of Education did not immediately return a message.\nA spokesperson for state Attorney General William Tong declined to comment.\nRelated Articles\n211 takes calls 24/7 to help people evade brutally cold conditions\nDemocratic-backed Connecticut bill would ban 'Latinx' term\n---\nHave a story idea or something on your mind you want to share?

Reacting to the AI created avatar, a fan wrote in the comment, Very creative love this. Good combination of mother and daughter, added another one. A fan from India also commented, Priyanka ki pari (Priyanka's princess/fairy).\"After more than a year of hiding Malti's face, Priyanka finally unveiled the adorable face of her baby girl, Malti Marie. The actor took Malti along to the Hollywood Walk of Fame where Nick Jonas and his brothers Joe and Kevin got a star in their honour. Fans who saw her for the first time said little Malti resembles Nick a lot.At the event, Nick delivered a special speech and won everyone's hearts. Dedicating to his family, he said, To my beautiful wife, you are the calm in the crazy, the rock in the storm and I love being married to you. It is the greatest gift. And I love being a parent with you, so Malti Marie, 'Hi, babe.' I can't wait to come back here with you in 15 years and embarrass you in front of your friends.Priyanka and Nick Jonas got married in 2018. They welcomed Malti via surrogacy. Her name is inspired by the middle name of the couple's mothers. Malti is now one year old. The family of three lives in their lavish bungalow in Los Angeles.Priyanka will now be seen in Hollywood films like Love Again and Ending Things.

Credit: Antonio Iavarone, M.D.\nFindings could introduce new and accurate AI-based opportunities in the clinical setting, potentially leading to personalized treatments for patients with otherwise lethal forms of cancer.\nScientists at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, collaborating with international researchers, have developed a sophisticated AI algorithm that performs advanced computational analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other cancers.\nTheir research is described in the February 2 issue of the journal Nature Cancer and could have profound implications for future treatment of GBM, an aggressive, usually fatal type of brain cancer, and certain breast, lung, and pediatric cancers.\nOur work represents translational science that offers immediate opportunities to change the way glioblastoma patients are routinely managed in the clinic, explained Antonio Iavarone, M.D., deputy director of Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and senior author of the study. Our algorithm offers applications to precision cancer medicine, giving oncologists a new tool to battle this deadly disease and other cancers as well.\nThe AI algorithm, known as SPHINKS  Substrate PHosphosite-based Inference for Network of KinaseS  deployed deep-\nmachine learningMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning is used to identify patterns in data, classify data into different categories, or make predictions about future events. It can be categorized into three main types of learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. data-gt-translate-attributes=[{attribute:data-cmtooltip, format:html}]>machine learning\nto help the researchers identify and experimentally validate two protein kinases (PKCd and DNAPKcs) as the culprits associated with tumor progression in two GBM subtypes and as potential therapeutic targets for other cancers.\nProtein kinases are the key targets currently used in precision cancer medicine to tailor treatment to a patients specific cancer properties. The most active kinases, which the researchers labeled master kinases in their paper, are those for which clinicians direct targeted drugs as a hallmark of current cancer treatment.\nIn addition to identifying the master kinases, Dr. Iavarone and colleagues used tumor organoids grown in the laboratory from patient samples  what they called patient-derived tumor avatars  to show that targeted drugs that interfere with the activity of master kinases can thwart tumor growth.\nPreviously, Dr. Iavarone and team had reported a new glioblastoma classification by capturing key tumor cell traits and grouping GBM patients based on their likelihood of survival and their tumors vulnerability to drugs. In the new study, these classifications were independently confirmed through several omics platforms: genomics (genes), proteomics (proteins) lipidomics (fat molecules), acetylomics (epigenetics), metabolomics (metabolites) and others.\nSPHINKS leverages machine learning to refine these omics datasets and create an interactome a complete set of biological interactions  to pinpoint the kinases that generate aberrant growth and treatment resistance in each glioblastoma subtype. These findings show that multi-omics data can generate new algorithms that predict which targeted therapies can provide the best therapeutic options based on each patients glioblastoma subtype.\nWe can now stratify glioblastoma patients based on biological features that are common between different omics, Dr. Iavarone said. Reading the genome alone has not been enough. We have needed more comprehensive data to identify tumor vulnerabilities.\nDespite breakthroughs for many other cancers, glioblastoma patients face dismal prognoses  the five-year survival rate is below 10%. Although numerous drugs are being developed as potential therapy, clinicians have needed a way to identify the molecular mechanisms that drive each patients disease and are applicable to precision cancer medicine.\nThe SPHINKS algorithm and related methods can be readily incorporated into molecular pathology labs, according to the researchers. Their paper includes a clinical classifier that can help assign the appropriate glioblastoma subtype to each patient. The team has also established an online portal to access the algorithm. The authors believe this approach can produce insightful information that could benefit as many as 75% of glioblastoma patients.\nThis classifier can be used in basically any lab, said Anna Lasorella, M.D., professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Sylvester CCC and co-senior author on the study. By importing the omics information into the web portal, pathologists receive classification information for one tumor, ten tumors, however many they import. These classifications can be applied immediately to patient care.\n.banner-1-multi-113{border:none!important;display:block!important;float:none!important;line-height:0;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-top:15px!important;max-width:100%!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center!important}\nWhile SPHINKS was first tested on glioblastoma, the algorithm is equally applicable to several other cancers. The team found the same cancer-driving kinases in breast, lung and pediatric brain tumors. Drs. Iavarone and Lasorella and colleagues believe this finding could be the impetus for a new type of clinical trial.\nWe are exploring the concept of basket trials, Dr. Iavarone explained, which would include patients with the same biological subtype but not necessarily the same cancer types. If patients with glioblastoma or breast or lung cancer have similar molecular features, they could be included in the same trial, he continued. Rather than doing multiple trials for a single agent, we could conduct one combined trial and potentially bring more effective drugs to more patients faster.\nReference: Integrative multi-omics networks identify PKCd and\nDNADNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule composed of two long strands of nucleotides that coil around each other to form a double helix.

I think I will call it Nothing Forever.'\nFriends, Im sure the conversation didnt go exactly like that, but the show is a very real creation of someone named Skyler Hartle, along with Brian Habersberger.\nPer Vice\n:\nAside from the artwork and the laugh track youll hear, everything else is generative, including: dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music, one of the creators\nwrote in a Reddit comment\n.\nDoes anyone else get the feeling were at the beginning of a horror movie here, where these small changes in the way things are made are going to have shockingly huge repercussions in a short amount of time? I sure do. Hartle explained, to Vice, exactly why, painting a picture of a future where AI-generated shows never have to end, and audience feedback directly affects what happens in a series.\nThis seems like a hellish landscape to me. A never-ending show that is completely tailored to an individual viewing experience.? Ew. Gross.\nFirst off, communal TV watching was a true joy of growing up. There was a special designation of honor for whoever got to go home early in high school because it meant they got to watch Passions, and anyone who is familiar with that show knows that an hour of Passions is like a season of any other show. They literally had an orangutan nurse named Nurse Precious, whom all the characters treated like a regular working nurse and never acknowledged that she was, you know, a primate.\nThe point is that the Passions viewer could come to school the next day and catch us all up on what was going on. Or, if by some chance it was a half day, or we had collectively decided to play hooky, we could all laugh about whatever we had watched the day before. It was a true bonding component of our friend group.\nSecondly, theres something disturbing about having content tailor itself to you. Where is the joy in discovering something new and out of your comfort zone? Its the equivalent of being an adult who never ventured outside of trying the foods they ate as a toddler. What is the point of all this suffering, taxes, heartache, and lack of elasticity in my damn skin if its not to grow and discover new things I enjoy as I age? The idea of coming home, turning on the TV, and having some computer tailor a program to my specific tastes is horrifying. Who is this for, exactly?\nI truly loathe the idea of taking art out of the hands of creatives and putting it into a computers algorithm to spit out a show tailored to what it thinks your interests are. Im also extremely confident that an algorithm could never have come up with the premise for Passions in a million years, let alone half the storylines on the show. (At one point, there\nwas a prolonged rollercoaster ride in hell\n; and dont get me started on Timmy, who was Tabitha the witchs evil doll, who eventually became a real boy because the Little Angel Girl made him one. I could go on and on.) A human can create from nothing, but a computer can only reassemble from the algorithm its been supplied with. I know which one I prefer.\nAdditionally, where is the chance for shows to improve and grow into classics? Parks and Rec and the US version of The Office notoriously had shaky first seasons before they grew into the beloved classics they are now. If the algorithm is constantly tweaking based on your feedback, the show (if you can call it that) never finds time to get its footing and cohesively gel, because youre never letting it.\nIm in no hurry for the future the Vice article lays out, and dont see why anyone would be, for the many reasons outlined above. I firmly believe we have to keep creative people involved in creative work and keep AI out of it for as long as we possibly can.\n(via Vice, featured image: NBC)\nHave a tip we should know?",

      "description": "The global warming threshold of 1.5 degree Celsius may be a foregone conclusion, according to a new study that trained an AI on climate models.",
      "body": "Well, that's not good.\nAI Assessment\nScientists enlisted the help of an AI to estimate how long it would take until global warming gets really bad. The AI's assessment? We might be screwed.\nThe resulting study, published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that global temperatures could reach the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius in just a decade. Exceed that, and scientists warn of increased drought, widescale die-offs of wildlife species and ecosystems, and famines, to name just a few drastic ramifications.\nThe legally binding Paris Agreement aims to not exceed this threshold by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and so far, we're already sitting at 1.1 to 1.2 degrees of warming.\nThe Paris Agreement maintains that, in the worst case scenario, the nations of the world ought to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. But the AI found we have a \"substantial probability\" of crossing even that threshold, at which scientists believe the effects of climate change will be irreversible and far more catastrophic, by 2050.\nMoved-Up Timeline\nTo produce these portentous predictions, the scientists trained a machine learning system on climate model outputs. During its training and testing, it was able to independently and accurately predict the timing of global warming temperatures in the past while only using maps of historical annual temperatures, according to the scientists.\nEven in the best-case scenario, the scientists found, the 1.5 degree threshold would be reached between 2033 to 2035, which isn't a lot of time.\nAs\nCNN\nnotes, this projected timeline is largely in line with the predictions of other significant reports. But the AI study has a far grimmer idea of when the 2 degree threshold will be reached, estimating close to an 80 percent chance that the world will hit that mark by 2065  and that's assuming we maintain net zero carbon emissions. Noah Diffenbaugh, co-author of the study and a climate scientist at Stanford University, told CNN that there's a 50 percent chance that 2 degrees will be reached even sooner  by 2050, if emissions stay high.\n\"[There is] is clear evidence that a half degree of global warming poses substantial risks for people and ecosystems,\" he added. \"Hence, the greater the global warming, the greater the challenges for adaptation.\"\nMore on climate change:",

These include live translated captions, custom organization Together Mode scenes, and a number of virtual appointments features\nMost Popular\nMore appealing to businesses are advanced meeting protections that boast a number of safeguards like watermarking and labeling sensitive content during meetings. From now on Microsoft Teams Premium users will also have the ability to restrict users from recording meetings and copying text from the meeting chat in order to deter leaks or keep discussions private.\nAs meetings have shifted to virtual and hybrid, it has created a new set of information protection challenges for organizations. Sensitive and confidential business conversations like board meetings, financial discussions, or undisclosed product reviews now happen through Teams meetings, noted Herskowitz.\nWhile setting up a Teams meeting is a quick and simple process, its critical for sensitive meetings to have an added layer of protection to help ensure the content and information remain secure.\nFinally, the advanced service also includes webinars so users can host events with registration waitlists, virtual green rooms, and customizable start and end times.

      "body": "Coding\nand computer programming are in-demand skills, but it's possible that ChatGPT and similar AI tools may fill in some of the gaps in the near future.\nTech jobs such as software developers, web developers, computer programmers, coders, and data scientists are \"pretty amenable\" to AI technologies \"displacing more of their work,\" Madgavkar said.\nThat's because AI like ChatGPT is good at crunching numbers with relative accuracy.\nIn fact, advanced technologies like ChatGPT could produce code faster than humans, which means that work can be completed with fewer employees, Muro said.\n\"What took a team of software developers might only take some of them,\" he added.\nTech companies like ChatGPT maker's OpenAI are already considering replacing software engineers with AI.\nStill, Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor, thinks that AI will help coders rather than replace them.\n\"In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,\" Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.\"\n\nMedia jobs (advertising, content creation, technical writing, journalism)\nExperts say AI like ChatGPT is good at producing written content and can do so \"more efficiently than humans.\"\nWestend61/Getty Images\nMedia jobs across the board  including those in advertising, technical writing, journalism, and any role that involves content creation  may be affected by ChatGPT and similar forms of AI, Madgavkar said. That's because AI is able to read, write, and understand text-based data well, she added.\n\"Analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of language based data and information is a skill that you'd expect generative AI technologies to ramp up on,\" Madgavkar said.\nEconomist Paul Krugman said in a New York Times op-ed that ChatGPT may be able to do tasks like reporting and writing \"more efficiently than humans.\"\nThe media industry is already beginning to experiment with AI-generated content. Tech news site CNET used an AI tool similar to ChatGPT to write dozens of articles  though the publisher has had to issue a number of corrections  and BuzzFeed announced that it will use tech from the ChatGPT maker to generate new forms of content.\nBut Madgavkar said that the majority of work done by content creators is not automatable.\n\"There's a ton of human judgment that goes into each of these occupations,\" she said.\n\n\nLegal industry jobs (paralegals, legal assistants)\nAI can replicate some of the work that paralegals and legal assistants do, though they aren't entirely replaceable, experts say.\nWorawee Meepian/Shutterstock\nLike media roles, jobs in the legal industry such as paralegals and legal assistants are responsible for consuming large amounts of information, synthesizing what they learned, then making it digestible through a legal brief or opinion.\nLanguage-oriented roles like these are susceptible to automation, Madgavkar said.\n\"The data is actually quite structured, very language-oriented, and therefore quite amenable to generative AI,\" she added.\nBut again, AI won't fully be able to automate these jobs since it requires a degree of human judgement to understand what a client or employer wants.\n\"It's almost like a bit of a productivity boost that some of these occupations might get, because you can use tools that actually do this better,\" Madgavkar said.\n\nMarket research analysts are susceptible to AI-driven change, says an expert.\nLaurence Dutton/Getty Images\nAI is good at analyzing data and predicting outcomes, Muro said. That is why market research analysts may be susceptible to AI-driven change.\nMarket research analysts are responsible for collecting data, identifying trends within that data, and then using what they found to design an effective marketing campaign or decide where to place advertising.\n\"Those are things that we're now seeing that AI could handle,\" Muro said.\nTeachers\nEven teachers are susceptible to job disruptions from AI.\nGetty Images\nTeachers across the country are worried about students using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework, but according to Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the department of computing and information sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology, they should also be thinking about their job security.\nChatGPT \"can easily teach classes already,\" Shi told the New York Post.\n\"Although it has bugs and inaccuracies in terms of knowledge, this can be easily improved,\" he said. \"Basically, you just need to train the ChatGPT.\"\nFinance jobs (Financial analysts, personal financial advisors)\nWorkers in the finance industry could be at risk for AI replacement, expert says.\nGetty Images\nLike market research analysts, financial analysts, personal financial advisors, and other jobs in personal finance that require manipulating significant amounts of numerical data can be affected by AI, Muro, the researcher at The Brookings Institute, said.\n\"AI can identify trends in the market, highlight what investments in a portfolio are doing better and worse, communicate all that, and then use various other forms of data by, say, a financial company to forecast a better investment mix,\" Muro said.\nThese analysts make a lot of money, he said, but parts of their jobs are automatable.\nTraders\nTraders work on the New York Stock Exchange floor in New York City.\nAP Photo/Ted Shaffrey\nThe Rochester Institute of Technology's Shi also told the New York Post that certain Wall Street roles could be in jeopardy as well.\n\"At an investment bank, people are hired out of college, and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling  you can get AI to do that,\" he said.\nGraphic designers\nAI has many graphic design abilities.\ncourtesy of Nguyen\nIn a December Harvard Business Review post, three professors pointed to DALL-E, an AI tool that can generate images in seconds, as a potential disruptor of the graphic design industry.\n\"Upskilling millions of people in their ability to create and manipulate images will have a profound impact on the economy,\" they wrote, adding that \"these recent advances in AI will surely usher in a period of hardship and economic pain for some whose jobs are directly impacted and who find it hard to adapt.\"\nAccountants\nAccountants may see their jobs at risk because of ChatGPT, experts say.\nseb_ra/Getty Images\nAccounting is generally viewed as a stable profession, but even employees in this industry could be at risk.\n\"Technology hasn't put everybody out of a job yet, but it does put some people out of a job,\" Brett Caraway, associate professor with the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto, said on Global News Radio 640 Toronto last week.\nCaraway added that \"intellectual labor\" in particular could be threatened.\n\"This could be lawyers, accountants,\" he said. \"It is something new, and it will be interesting to see just how disruptive and painful it is to employment and politics.\"\nCustomer service agents",

      "body": "0\nMr Shishir Jaipuria, Chairman, Seth Anandram Jaipuria Group of Educational Institutions, and Chairman of FICCI Arise\nThe Union Budget 2023-24 spells out progressive initiatives and reforms for the Indian education sector in many areas, including skill development, teacher training, future readiness of learners, and greater accessibility of learning content.\nThe most outstanding feature of the budget is the announcement of the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 which will be focused on skill development of youth in not just the conventional domains, but also new-age disciplines like Artificial Intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, and 3D printing. The Yojana will be an excellent catalyst for bringing skill development on par with academic excellence in the Indian education system by setting up 30 Skill India International Centres. It will also help to bring 20 million out-of-school children back into mainstream education. At the same time, the proposal of setting up three centers of excellence for Artificial Intelligence in educational institutions is a welcome move towards creating human resources with competencies to leverage new technologies for innovations in different sectors. Additionally, the decision to extend a stipend to 47 lakh youth under the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme through direct transfer benefits will help to boost employability and practical application of skills.\nThe Union Budget addresses the important issue of professional development and recruitment of teachers with the announcement of the District Institutes of Education and Training and the proposal to recruit over 38,800 teachers in Eklavya model residential schools.\nThe vision of the National Education Policy 2020 to make education equitable and inclusive will be furthered with the setting up of the National Digital Library for children and adolescents along with physical libraries at panchayats and wards, as recommended in the budget. This move shall make learning content accessible to millions of needy learners across the country.\nAll in all, this is a balanced budget that meets our expectations to strengthen the underpinnings of the Indian education sector for realizing the countrys demographic dividend and creating a knowledge-based economy.\n-Prof Arvind Chaturvedi (Pro Vice-Chancellor, IILM University, Gurugram)\nAn 8% increase in allocation to the education sector (over 2022-23) is not sufficient. Higher allocation was expected this year.\nEducationists were expecting a larger increase to meet the NEP target of 6% of GDP. In that sense it is disappointing.\nHowever, the focus of FM budget proposals has been on IT education and skill development, which is welcome.\nThe highlights which India should appreciate are:\nTarget of training 47 lakh youths in 3 years under PMKVY 4.0, a national apprentice Scheme, on-the-job training in partnership with industry in coding /IOT/Drones/ Mechatronics/AI is indeed welcome as it will create a huge technically qualified manpower and India will be an IT superpower. 5G centers in 100 engineering colleges is appreciated.\nOpening libraries, both digital and physical, in rural areas will go a long way in increasing literacy levels as well as the enrolment ratio in rural India.\nBudget focus on primary teachers training, recruitment of 38000 teachers for Eklavya schools, and opening of 157 nursing colleges along with existing medical colleges is appreciated as a step in the right direction.\nI especially welcome the plan to convert DIETs (District Institutes of Education & Training) into vibrant institutes of excellence.\nIndia now has more private universities than the state & central universities and therefore liberal grants should have been announced for private education providers in the higher education sector.\nIn a related sector, the announcement of National Data Governance is a welcome step.\n(1 February 2023)\n************************************\nMs. Radhika Shrivastava, Executive Director, FIIB (Fortune Institute of International Business)\nThe announcement to strengthen teacher training via innovative pedagogy, curriculum transaction, continuous professional development, integration of ICT, and much more is a commendable initiative by the honorable Finance Minister to enhance the delivery of education and the implementation of technology in Indias education segment.\nAlso, the decision to transform the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET) into vibrant institutes of excellence and establish a National Digital Library for children and adolescents will serve as a stepping stone for improving foundational literacy and numeracy among children.\nFacilitating states to establish physical libraries at the panchayat levels and offer access to national digital library resources will further create a conducive learning environment and nurture communication and creative skills among students. Moreover, the decision to recruit 38,000 teachers and support staff for 740 Eklavya Model Residential Schools is a thoughtful decision to move towards the uniform quality of education across the country.\nOverall, the Union Budget 2023 unveils some key actions to overcome the learning losses of the Covid-19 pandemic, fueling the digitization of education and driving uniform delivery of education in the country. These announcements are expected to fast-track the implementation of NEP 2020 and achieve its end objectives.\n************************************\nRajkishan S.S, Ph.D. | Professor of Economics IILM University Greater Noida\nThe debate is on the fact whether the last major budget before elections has lived up to its expectations or not! This budget will be touted as one which has something to please everyone! From the impressive hike in infrastructure spending to the increase in the number of Eklavya Model Residential schools benefiting 3.5 lakh tribal students, the setting up of a National digital library for Kids and adolescents and skill India international centers, and the tax rebates to the middle class, industry and the rich, the budget proposals are attractive. The catch always lies in the intent and speed of implementation!",

      "body": "Share on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\n(CNN) - Recent artificial intelligence tools appear to be able to do what humans can and faster, but that means some people may be out of a job.\nAI experts said the technology will actually create a large number of employment opportunities.\nShelly Palmer, a professor of advanced media at Syracuse University, said jobs like middle managers, salespeople, writers and journalists, accountants and bookkeepers, and doctors who specialize in things like drug interactions are doomed when it comes to the possibility of AI being incorporated into their jobs.\nPalmer said jobs like these will all use AI but not necessarily be replaced by AI entirely.\nIts not going to replace you. Someone who knows how to use it well is going to take your job, and thats a guarantee, she said.\nBy 2025, the World Economic Forum predicts that 85 million jobs will be displaced by automation and technology, but it will also create 97 million new roles.\nThis is something the nation has seen before, specifically in the automobile industry.\nWhile the auto worker may be displaced because they are not as good at welding or as painting as the robot, there are probably 35 people that have to be involved in the creation and maintenance of that device that welds better than a person, Palmer said.\nAt Carbon Robotics, former autoworkers are building an AI laser weeder in Detroit for farms.\nIts a direct result of the history of auto manufacturing that we have that skillset available to us all in one place, founder and CEO Paul Mikesell said.\nThe laser weeder, still operated by a human but run by AI, can do the work of between 40 to 80 people, according to Mikesell.\nLabor is harder and harder to find every year, particularly farm labor. An AI system like ours that can do that job automatically saves a lot of time, money, effort, he said.\nSome music is composed solely by AI called Aiva. It is trained on tens of thousands of classic music scores and even has an album that you can stream.\nAI music is more affordable, and there is no producer, composer or artist to pay.\nIts taking away opportunity from songwriters, producers and artists, the people who are trying to feed their families, said Karl Fowlkes, entertainment and business attorney at The Fowlkes Firm.\nSomething similar is happening in the art world.\nArtist Karla Ortiz and two others filed a class action lawsuit against three AI art companies for copyright infringement.\nOrtiz claims they are using her name and art to train the AI.\nThe life of an artist is not an easy one. Its feast and famine for most of us. We go job by job, and what happens when theres a little bit less work to go around? she said.\nStability AI, one of the companies named, says the suit misunderstands how AI and copyright law work, adding that it intends to defend ourselves and the vast potential generative AI has to expand the creative power of humanity.\nThe two other companies did not respond.\nI never thought wed be here. Its like straight out of a sci-fi movie, Ortiz said.\nPalmer said that we are just people, and AI is beneficial.\nThis is not coming to kill us. Its coming to help us, she said.\nCopyright 2023 CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.\nMost Read",

      "body": "AI video surveillance technology will be used for incident detection during the 2024 Summer Olympics in France, but not facial recognition.French Senators this week okayed a bill which excludes the use of biometrics and any other facial recognition technology during the sporting event to be staged in Paris.The baton has now been passed on to the National Assembly which is expected to deliver its verdict on the draft legislation this month.The vote from the Senators comes days after the countrys privacy watchdog had urged them not to endorse any government plan for the use of facial recognition systems during the games.Last month, the Senators had put off a planned vote on the bill to institute rules and regulations to govern the games, among which was the proposed use of facial recognition technology. The legislators had said given the complex nature of facial recognition systems, a separate law would be more appropriate.The bill recently voted by the French Senators allows for the use of CCTV cameras and drones around game venues and in other public places such as streets and public transportation. The recorded footage, which will not include personal data, will be analyzed to detect premeditated events, abnormal behavior or incidents that portend danger for persons attending the games.Results of the analysis will immediately be sent to the police and other law enforcement officers for them to take required actions, the publication explains.The video surveillance system will be installed by spring and will be in place till 30 June 2025. It will be used on experimental basis, officials say.This processing does not use any biometric identification system, does not process any biometric data and does not implement any facial recognition technique. They cannot carry out any reconciliation, interconnection or automated linking with other processing of personal data, reads a portion of the bill as translated by Google.Government ministers have backed the bill saying the move will provide added security during the games.However, rights advocates think the measure could be exploited by security agencies to trample on privacy rights.Amnesty International, which in January 2021 launched a campaign for a ban on facial recognition systems, has called the move a dangerous step for human and privacy rights, according to The Guardian.The publication quotes Katia Roux, technology and human rights officer at the global rights watchdog as expressing worries over the decision.In terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms, we consider the proposal presents a danger to the right to a private life, it could also impact freedom of expression, freedom to meet, and the principle of non-discrimination, Roux says.",

      "body": "Sensorium Galaxy\nAlmost every part of todays digitally-run society relies on artificial intelligence.\nAnd with the emergence of increasingly more advanced technology, its become imperative to ponder about what the world of tomorrow might look like. Perhaps the answer can be found in a major tech breakthrough thats well underway in a very different and otherworldly realm.\nThats as the first intelligent and autonomous avatars are making a grand entrance in the metaverse, taking over a series of burgeoning virtual worlds as digital companions, assistants, entertainers and creators. Breaking away from traditional chatbots like Siri or Alexa, whose capabilities are limited by the scenarios and scripts theyve been trained on, these new AI lifeforms hold the promise of becoming a meaningful experience for human users in virtual settings thanks to a combination of different cutting-edge advancements.\nEquipped with complex conversational skills alongside unprecedented memory capabilities, AI-driven virtual beings are not only capable of having hours-long conversations across a wide range of topics and themes, but also recall past interactions they had with a human, anchoring all of their communications on context and associative memory.\nHowever, the game-changing prowess of this new breed of avatars is perhaps even more obvious through a display of a number of traits that we would only typically associate with humans.\nEach AI-driven virtual being can be fitted with a so-called virtual soul or consciousness, which users will be able to configure choosing from a pool of options, including biographical details, habits, career goals, needs and even hidden personality indicators.\nVoid of prejudice, biases, beliefs and any preconceived notions about a person, virtual beings have the potential to become the companion we always longed for but never had.\nThe metaverse also presents an exciting blank canvas for users, creators and artists. In it, emerging technology is already supporting new ways of conceptualising, creating and experiencing the arts, with AI avatars taking on the role of co-creators.\nIn the not so distant future, AI DJs are poised to become commonplace, dishing out supercharged futuristic tracks in virtual reality worlds imagined to take music and entertainment into uncharted territory, and introduce human senses to unknown dimensions.\nCurrently, generative AI technology is already enabling AI-driven performers to independently mix and match from over 60 different music genres, creating not only full music sets but also the worlds first AI albums. And while theyre yet to score a number one hit, theres no stopping these AI superstars as they continue a slow re-jig of the creative scene in the metaverse and beyond.\nAI holds the promise of a future thats exponentially better than today  and then some more.\nWith AI-enabled chatbots forecast to balloon to a $4.6 billion global market by 2026, as per QY Research, there will be no industry left untouched, from healthcare and retail to banking and tourism.\nAmidst this boom, virtual worlds are rapidly becoming the testing ground for many of the next decades most significant technological advancements.\nAnd so, we might soon be arriving at the next digital frontier. In it, AI beings take centre stage in our social lives, taking us through the metaverse and the many unfolding digital experiences that the future holds as companions, co-creators, entertainers and the faithful presence were long been waiting for.\nShare this article",

      "body": "High-throughput screen for determinants of prime editing efficiency. Credit:\nNature Biotechnology\n(2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41587-022-01613-7\nResearchers at the University of Zurich have developed a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to predict the efficacy of various genome-editing repair options. Unintentional errors in the correction of DNA mutations of genetic diseases can thus be reduced.\nGenome editing technologies offer great opportunities for treating genetic diseases. Methods such as the widely used CRISPR/Cas9 gene scissors directly address the cause of the disease in the DNA. The scissors are used in the laboratory to make targeted modifications to the genetic material in cell lines and model organisms and to study biological processes.\nA further development of this classic CRISPR/Cas9 method is called prime editing. Unlike conventional gene scissors, which create a break in both strands of the DNA molecule, prime editing cuts and repairs DNA on a single strand only. The prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) precisely targets the relevant site in the genome and provides the new genetic information, which is then transcribed by a \"translation enzyme\" and incorporated into the DNA.\nFinding the most efficient DNA repair options\nPrime editing promises to be an effective method of repairing disease-causing mutations in patients' genomes. However, when it comes to applying it successfully, it is important to minimize unintended side effects such as errors in DNA correction or alteration of DNA elsewhere in the genome. According to initial studies, prime editing leads to a significantly lower number of unintended changes than conventional CRISPR/Cas9 approaches.\nHowever, researchers currently still have to spend a significant amount of time optimizing the pegRNA for a specific target in the genome. \"There are over 200 repair possibilities per mutation. In theory, we would have to test every single design option each time to find the most efficient and accurate pegRNA,\" says Gerald Schwank, professor at the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Zurich (UZH).\nAnalyzing a large data set with AI\nSchwank and his research group needed to find an easier solution. Together with Michael Krauthammer, UZH professor at the Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, and his team, they developed a method that can predict the efficiency of pegRNAs. By testing over 100,000 different pegRNAs in human cells, they were able to generate a comprehensive prime editing data set. This enabled them to determine which properties of a pegRNAsuch as the length of the DNA sequence, the sequence of DNA building blocks or the shape of the DNA moleculepositively or negatively influence the prime editing process.\nSubsequently, the team developed an AI-based algorithm to recognize patterns in the pegRNA of relevance for efficiency. Based on these patterns, the trained tool can predict both the effectiveness and accuracy of genome editing with a particular pegRNA. \"In other words, the algorithm can determine the most efficient pegRNA for correcting a particular mutation,\" says Michael Krauthammer. The tool has already been successfully tested in human and mice cells and is freely available to researchers.\nFurther pre-clinical studies are still needed before the new prime editing tool can be used in humans. However, the researchers are confident that in the foreseeable future it will be possible to use prime editing to repair the DNA mutations of common inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis or metabolic diseases.\nThe study is published in the journal\nNature Biotechnology",

      "body": "Share\nThe US federal government is adopting military-grade AI that was used to crack down on ISIS to censor dissent by US citizens on issues like election fraud and vaccine hesitancy, according to the executive director of the Foundation for Freedom Online, Mike Benz.\nPrivate firms and universities have received millions of dollars in grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF), a federal agency, to develop tools similar to those developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencys Social Media in Strategic Communications (SMISC) program in 2011.\nSMISCs tools were used to help identify misinformation or deception campaigns and counter them with truthful information, in the Middle East. In a report, Mike Benz detailed how the NSF and other organizations are using this technology to censor the speech of Americans.\nOne of the most disturbing aspects of the Convergence Accelerator Track F domestic censorship projects is how similar they are to military-grade social media network censorship and monitoring tools developed by the Pentagon for the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism contexts abroad, reads the report.\nSpeaking to Just the News, he said: DARPA&rsquor;s been funding an AI network using the science of social media mapping dating back to at least 2011-2012, during the Arab Spring abroad and during the Occupy Wall Street movement here at home. They then bolstered it during the time of ISIS to identify homegrown ISIS threats in 2014-2015.\nAccording to Benz, the NSF has adopted DARPAs technology to target two groups of Americans: those skeptical of recent election results and those who claim COVID-19 vaccines could be harmful.\nThe terrifying thing is, as all of this played out, it was redirected inward during 2016  domestic populism was treated as a foreign national security threat, Benz said.\nWhat you&rsquor;ve seen is a grafting on of these concepts of mis- and disinformation that were escalated to such high-intensity levels in the news over the past several years being converted into a tangible, formal government program to fund and accelerate the science of censorship, he said.\nYou had this project at the National Science Foundation called the Convergence Accelerator, Benz recounted, which was created by the Trump administration to tackle grand challenges like quantum technology. When the Biden administration came to power, they basically took this infrastructure for multidisciplinary science work to converge on a common science problem and took the problem of what people say on social media as being on the level of, say, quantum technology.\nAnd so they created a new track called the track F program  and it&rsquor;s for trust and authenticity,&rsquor; but what that means is, and what it&rsquor;s a code word for is, if trust in the government or trust in the media cannot be earned, it must be installed. And so they are funding artificial intelligence, censorship capacities, to censor people who distrust government or media.\nBenz noted how mainstream media and fact-checkers have become arbiters of truth, determining what is acceptable and unacceptable to post online, and how the pandemic has normalized censorship in the name of public health.\nWhat&rsquor;s happened now is the government says, Okay, we&rsquor;ve established this normative foothold in it being okay to [censor political speech], now we&rsquor;re going to supercharge you guys with all sorts of DARPA military grade censorship, weaponry, so that you can now take what you&rsquor;ve achieved in the censorship space and scale it to the level of a U.S. counterinsurgency operation, Benz explained.\nIf you're tired of censorship, cancel culture, and the erosion of civil liberties",

      "body": "Tweet\nA new survey of 300 organizations across the US and Europe looks at the key challenges concerning the ability to effectively prioritize and contextualize the large amounts of data organizations get from several cyber security alert systems, as well as identifying the actions needed to meet them.\nThe survey, conducted for Darktrace by IDC, finds evolving attack vectors make it difficult to prepare proactively, with only 31 percent of respondents highly confident that their tools can continuously adjust to new configurations.\nRespondents also report a lack of dynamic testing capabilities with 65 percent agreed that pen testing provides only a snapshot in time which is of limited value, as it quickly becomes out of date. While 76 percent think visualizing attack paths is of moderate or high importance, only 29 percent are highly confident they have a robust mechanism to test their environments against the most current threat vectors.\nAdvertisement\nThe number of organizations that can continuously run preventative exercises such as pen tests and attack surface evaluation is between only 24 percent and 31 percent across all sectors.\n\"It's clear from this study that organizations need to adopt a holistic approach to improve their readiness,\" says Christopher Kissel, research vice president of IDC's Security and Trust Products. \"The solution is to create a virtuous cycle, leveraging AI to create an ecosystem across an entire organization able to continuously stress-test environments, give an instantaneous response, and determine if remediation is working.\"\nThe report calls for, \"a multi-pronged approach that includes establishing a security posture and proactively managing the access and assets, monitoring what is happening in the environment, and ensuring a fit-for-purpose remediation approach including backup and disaster recovery.\"\nThe study also highlights AI as a solution for improved detection and response capabilities and continuous monitoring, as well as playing an integral part in the 'virtuous cycle', citing AI's ability to look for subtle changes in the behaviors of entities within a network.\nThe full report is available here.\nImage credit:",

      "body": "Matrix multiplications at the speed of light\nFebruary 2, 2023\nInternational Society for Optics and Photonics\nElectro-optic blocks cointegrated for the development of a neuromorphic photonic processor.\nAll things are numbers, avowed Pythagoras. Today, 25 centuries later, algebra and mathematics are everywhere in our lives, whether we see them or not. The Cambrian-like explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) brought numbers even closer to us all, since technological evolution allows for parallel processing of a vast amounts of operations.\nProgressively, operations between scalars (numbers) were parallelized into operations between vectors and, subsequently, matrices. Multiplication between matrices now trends as the most time- and energy- demanding operation of contemporary AI computational systems. A technique called tiled matrix multiplication (TMM) helps to speed computation by decomposing matrix operations into smaller tiles to be computed by the same system in consecutive time slots. But modern electronic AI engines, employing transistors, are approaching their intrinsic limits and can hardly compute at clock-frequencies higher than ~2 GHz.\nThe compelling credentials of light  ultrahigh speeds and significant energy and footprint savings  offer a solution. Recently a team of photonic researchers of the WinPhos Research group, led by Prof. Nikos Pleros, from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, harnessed the power of light to develop a compact silicon photonic compute engine capable of computing TMMs at a record-high 50 GHz clock frequency.\nAs reported in Advanced Photonics\n, they employ silicon-germanium electro-absorption modulators and a novel neuromorphic architectural design capable of encoding and computing data. According to corresponding author George Giamougiannis, This work paves the way for the resolution of DLbased applications that require line-rate computations, and the work promises to contribute significantly to data center cybersecurity.\nData center cybersecurity: Light hunting the evil\nUndoubtedly, the AI burst has equipped both benign and wicked users with strong toolkits to speed-up and automate their activities. With the data travelling in the data centers (DCs) augmenting by ~13 percent yearbyyear, they have become a major target for malicious individuals who aim to compromise sensitive data, e.g., financial data, personal information, and intellectual property of many organizations, including government agencies, military forces, hospitals, and financial institutions. On that account, DC cybersecurity is imperative to prevent invaders accessing classified information.\nIndeed, threat detection mechanisms face a new set of requirements resulting from the quantity of data flowing through the vast number of servers and switches within contemporary DCs. Real-time threat detection is imperative: packet inspection must be processed at ultrahigh speeds. Moreover, threats must be detected as early as possible within the route of the malicious packets: every DC node should be equipped with a powerful cybersecurity toolkit.\nExploiting their ultrafast processor, the researchers from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in collaboration with NVIDIAs experts in the field of DC cybersecurity, successfully merged silicon photonics with AI to establish a framework to identify successfully and swiftly one of the most common types of DC attacks, namely distributed denialofservice (DDoS) attacks, in NVIDIAs servers at linerates. Thanks to this novel computational scheme, the number may soon be up for DC attacks  at least for the time being.\nRead the Gold Open Access article by Giamougiannis et al., ",

      "body": "But what is really game-changing here?\nWhat impact will it have on business models big and small?\nAre investors right to join the public excitement or are there reasons to temper our enthusiasm?\nStepping back, we can trace ChatGPT's abilities to Google's 2017 breakthrough in a deep learning technique called a 'transformer', a form of machine learning used for training generative AI models.\nThis transformer enabled speech and text to be converted to machine-readable text and started an exponential evolution in the size of AI models trained on massive data sets that were then able to generate text, images - even music.\nAs the number of model parameters expanded, improvements in the accuracy and sophistication of the models' outputs dramatically increased.\nThe early generative AI models started with around 100 million parameters.\nThe GPT-3 model that led to ChatGPT's chatbot service was originally built on 175 billion parameters.\nNewer models are over 500 billion, and some even approach 1 trillion parameters.\nNone of this comes cheap.\nReports on Microsoft's investments in their partnership with OpenAI suggests over $11bn has been spent to date, enabling OpenAI to offer the ChatGPT service for free to the general public - arguably the greatest step change the project has delivered, opening the floodgates of innovation to all.\nComputer servers used for AI required significantly higher performance and more expensive semiconductors to be able to cope with the demands of ingesting and making sense of the massive datasets available from scraping the public internet.\nThis huge upfront cost has until now been a block to widespread access to powerful AI tools.\nPublic clouds drive innovation and competition - a redux\nThe recent history of public cloud evolution provides a blueprint for how the AI economy will grow and prosper.\nIn the last decade, the public clouds have pursued a dual track of building their own software applications and tools native to their own clouds, but at the same time worked in partnership with third-party vendors that built competing and often superior products.\nIMF raises global growth forecast but UK set to shrink\nDatadog's observability tools compete with AWS's Cloudwatch; Netflix competes with Amazon Prime, etc.\nThe largest infrastructure providers and the disruptive new entrants can thrive as the exponentially improving capabilities both sustain the improvements in existing products as well as create whole new markets yet to be monetised.\nSpeedbumps will inevitably temper growth\nA dose of caution is needed though.\nAs AI is trained on vast open datasets, often without human supervision, the risks of bias and prejudice are ever present.\nOpenAI's improvements to their models have included reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to 'teach' the models not to be racist, misogynist or otherwise biased.\nCyber security analysts are concerned that generative AI models will raise both the quantity and the sophistication of phishing and malware attacks used to steal security credentials and sensitive data.\nThe companies looking to adopt AI are wrestling with the balance between going all-in on AI with all the risk of reputational damage and regulatory penalties that entails, versus being slower to market while trying to address the failings of the models, running the risk that more reckless competitors may steal a march on the market.\nThe Infrastructure spend is just getting started\nChatGPT is reportedly built on 10,000 graphics processing chips (GPUs) designed by nVidia and manufactured by TSMC.\nThe largest infrastructure providers go even further to profit from the scale of the opportunity by designing their own application specific chips, such as Google's TPU, or AWS's Trainium chips, with leading foundry, TSMC, again the manufacturer of choice. \nGenerative AI's promise is so vast, and the dissemination of these tools so rapid that we see both wild optimism and deep fear in equal measure.\nDespite seemingly putting the brakes on the AI will solve everything' zeitgeist, the productivity gains to the whole economy from widespread adoption of general-purpose AI tools for automating any digital process, of which ChatGPT is just one of many, will offer a long run way of investment and innovation that investors should very much be paying attention to.\nMatthew Ward is head of global technology equities and Colin Moar is co-fund manager of the Barings Global Technology fund\nShare",

      "body": "Cathie Wood has picked a stock she thinks will be an artificial intelligence (AI) boom winner.Exact Sciences (EXAS) stock is up more than 40% in 2023.Now, Wood believes it is well-positioned to keep growing as AI overtakes the market.In November 2021, Cathie Wood described artificial intelligence as the next big frontier of the tech sector. Roughly a year later, OpenAI released advanced chatbot ChatGPT, and almost overnight, the ways investors viewed AI began to shift. Now the market is experiencing an AI boom that is likely to keep expanding. As part of this, Wood is doubling down on one particular company leading the way in artificial intelligence: Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS). Exact Sciences operates in the molecular diagnostics space and it is known for cancer detection. Wood feels it has a clear edge over competitors and given its 48% surge year to date, she may just be right about EXAS stock. Lets take a look at her latest big bet and why other investors should care. Why Cathie Wood Is Bullish on EXAS Stock For Wood, her strategy with EXAS stock comes down to one word: data. Specifically, it comes down to the edge that she feels data gives the company. She recently appeared on on CNBC where she discussed the importance of data and AI. In her words: Many people say data is the new gold as they were talking about the cloud and other movements in technology, I think thats ever more true now with artificial intelligence. As Wood sees it, proprietary data is the key to succeeding in an economy rapidly shifting toward artificial intelligence. This is where Exact Sciences comes into play. In her view, the company has a clear competitive edge due to its data on cancer and its strong global distribution, which can be partially attributed to its molecular diagnostic testing franchise. EXAS stock is currently the third-largest holding in Woods ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), occupying roughly 7.5% of the portfolio at a value of $600.7 million. The only two companies above it are pandemic-era winners Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM). EXAS stock is also the top holding in Woods ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG), occupying more than 11% of the fund with a market value of $256,125,641.60. Both funds have been performing very well since the year began. What Comes Next For many investors, the name Cathie Wood is synonymous with contrarian bets. But EXAS stock doesnt seem like a contrarian play at all. Instead, it is a high-performing company with significant growth potential. And Wood sees the company as having room to grow as the AI boom takes shape. As CNBC reports: In its base case, Ark believes Exact Sciences could compound at an average annual rate of 25%, reaching $140 by 2027. The stock traded around $67 apiece on Wednesday. As of this writing, EXAS stock is trading above $70 per share. If Woods bullish thesis is correct, Exact Sciences will be in an excellent position to ride the AI wave to the top.
