      "body": "Share to Linkedin\nTesting artificial intelligence (AI) tools is a losing game. It is a machine, after all, and does not get tired. I do. Look at the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot pictured here and tell me thats not happy mode. Built-in enthusiasm, high energy, and confidence to never stop going.\nA Boston Dynamics Atlas robot performs a jump during a demonstration, Wednesday, Jan. 13, 2021, at\n... [+]\nthe company's facilities in Waltham, Mass. The company engineered the robot to be able to dance in a fluid manner that is almost human. (AP Photo/Josh Reynolds)\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\nI need some of that robot energy to help me as I keep testing various prompts, concepts, parameters with the plan (and hope) to uncover techniques and tips that will help readers get more out of the tool and thus be more productive (built into that premise is as we are more productive it grants us more free time - I am not sure about that one, either). Onward and upward, this is still a ton of fun.\nOver the past few weeks and months, across various AI platforms and in discussions with people far more expert than me. I have been compiling a list of key lessons and takeaways, but by the time I finish testing there could be a whole new generation of powerful tools that make this effort redundant.\nFull disclosure: I am testing these platforms but I am not using the results in my writing here (thats against the rules, for sure), not as a direct copy and paste, and I almost entirely try to do the research using topics and ideas that are unrelated to the post itself as you will see in todays example of creating outlines with ChatGPT. Simplified screenshots, as in removing all of my back and forth with Verby (what I call ChatGPT now) to follow.\nOne of the great things about ChatGPT is it forces almost everyone to step back and reevaluate ones own creativity, skill, methods, and output. Normally, I do not create an outline when I write, although I certainly learned how to do them in high school and college as a way to frame ones thoughts and ideas and stay pointed in the right direction. Mostly, I free write (almost like free climbing without the death threat) and then an outline emerges. Sometimes.\nMORE FOR YOU\nThredUP Teams With Nava Rose To Help Users Dump Fast Fashion\nNaturally, a quick search brought up some excellent results: Whats the best way to outline an article? and up pops one from Grammarly, one of the cool writing assistants that has been around for a while (and which I think is built into numerous writing platforms): How Outlining Is Essential to Your Writing. Grammarly has an excellent blog and approach to helping you improve, with and without their service.\nSo I popped their suggested outline into ChatGPT and asked it what it thought, heres the screenshot and it gave them high marks with a couple of suggestions.\nGetting help from ChatGPT with creating an outline. First part is the excellent Grammarly post\n... [+]\n(linked above) explaining how to build an outline in topic form. Second part is ChatGPT praise and suggestions.\nChatGPT Screenshot by TJ McCue\nThen, as you will see, I asked it to condense it as you can see below. I clipped a portion of the ChatGPT conversation as there was a bit more back and forth. I could have also simply asked it for an outline on the topic of mindfulness.\nCondensing an outline with ChatGPT help\nChatGPT screenshot by TJ McCue\nIn a similar vein, I took an old article of mine and asked it to reverse engineer my copy and to give me an outline of that article. I will not bore you with the back and forth, but it did a good job, of course, of breaking apart my long article. I asked it for an outline of my piece, a list of key takeaways in bullet point form, and a narrative summary. That was all in the prompt that looked like this (and yes, I always ask politely):\nPROMPT: Please create a detailed outline from this text, then create a summary of key points, then a narrative summary of the full text (thank you): 2,083 words of TEXT Pasted\nIn my piece last week, I mentioned I have had luck with posting up to as much as 2,500 words and asking ChatGPT to dissect, rearrange, rewrite, and so forth. Anything over that, can prompt an error, at least that has been my experience. You can read that post here: ChatGPT Hack For Summarizing Your Work. Extra tip: When engaging with ChatGPT, if you get an error, and then another, just refresh your page.\nFinally, my last method is the one I mentioned in my review-ish post about Otter.ai, and it is this  I record a ton of my ideas into my Easy Voice Recorder app (which I love and should review soon) and then upload those three to five minute one-sided MP3 audio conversations to Otter, which transcribes them.\nThat transcribed content goes directly into ChatGPT (for these tests and beyond) and I ask it to outline my thoughts, or summarize it, and so on. It is 100 percent me writing audibly and something I have been doing for years; it is just easier now with the apps and tools we have.\nChatGPT takes my content and operates as what I see as my assistant, my part time editor, to help me make sense of my own thoughts. Not sure thats a true hack, but it does save me a ton of time (the Otter.ai part does). The back and forth with ChatGPT Verby takes more time thus my starting comment of being tired. Not truly tired, but aware that I will lose this game of wits and stamina as the Atlas Robot jumps with joy. Hopefully, the AI tools will figure out how to bottle that up, too.\nFollow me on",

      "description": "A fake song in the style of Bob Dylan reminds the author that, despite fears about artificial intelligence, technology has delivered him great stories.",
      "body": "Very large text size\nAdvertisement\nOne of my daughters asked her computer the other day to write a song as if it were written by Bob Dylan.\nNaughtily, her request  through the much ballyhooed artificial intelligence app ChatGPT  was that the song be about an old newspaper journalist who is confused by online reporting.\nWithin eight seconds, her screen filled with computer-composed lyrics.\nHe was an old-timer, with ink-stained hands/ He wrote for the paper, on the newsstands/ He knew the city, and the people too/ But the world was changing, and he didnt know what to do.\nChorus: Hes an old journalist, with a pen and a pad/ But the online reporting, is making him feel real sad/ Hes confused by the screens, and the pixels too/ Hes an old-timer, whos feeling real blue.\nReading these lines, created without the touch of a human hand, let alone the genius of Bob Dylan, this old journalist  who started on a beaten-up typewriter in the age of ink more than half a century ago, and who still likes talking face-to-face to get a decent yarn  began to feel something close to melancholy.\nMeanwhile, a lot of people, unsurprisingly, are getting mighty worried about this new artificial intelligence app that can write an essay, poem or song about almost anything within seconds, and in the style of anyone from Proust to an 11-year-old student at school.\nLoading\nMany fear the potential for AI to veer off the rails, disseminate misinformation, take over the jobs of writers and other creatives and dumb down students willing to outsource their studies to the app.\nAdvertisement\nYou need only hear the nauseating revelations spewing from the witness stand at the royal commission into robo-debt to understand that replacing responsible human discernment with trust in algorithms can destroy vulnerable lives, and has done so.\nBut right now, Im holding off judgment on ChatGPT.\nLong ago, between Boxing Day 1996 and the first weeks of 1997, I discovered that online technology could become useful in the most surprising ways.\nBy happy accident, I learned that the only Fairfax computer linked to the internet in the Canberra press gallery at the time could give me access to the Paris headquarters of the Vendee Globe round-the-world yacht race.\nIt would plug me into the centre of the worlds biggest story of those weeks, and almost no one  including me  figured out quite how I did it.\nAs Australian rescue authorities tried to find a series of yachtsmen shipwrecked and lost in the storm-blown Southern Ocean, I was astounded to discover I had instant, magical access to the imperilled yachties tortured distress messages, starting with those of Frenchman Raphael Dinelli as his craft was thrashed by a fearful gale and upended by huge seas.\nDinellis satellite messages to race headquarters in Paris were accompanied by transcripts of even more dramatic telex transmissions (HQ didnt use the word email) from fellow yachtsman Pete Goss, an Englishman who put his own life at great risk to sail to Dinellis deliverance.\nTony Wright reports on the plight of Raphael Dinelli, December 28, 1996.\nCredit:\nFairfax archives\nThis would have been treasure at any time, but it was beyond price during the otherwise dead news time from Boxing Day into January.\nAmazingly, I had stumbled on a trove of exclusives delivered by the internet from deep in the Southern Ocean. Truth was, only a piddling 4 per cent of Australian households had access to the internet in 1996, and few journalists knew how to use it, or had access at work.\nAnd so, after a photo was taken from a RAAF search plane of Dinelli standing knee-deep in freezing water on his sinking yacht amid giant seas 2220 kilometres south-west of Perth, I was able to reel in readers by reporting Dinellis struggle to survive, and those of his rescuer, Goss, in their own words, though I would never meet either of them face-to-face.\nMy story accompanying the photo called Dinelli the loneliest man on Earth. He was also the luckiest. A liferaft was dropped to him 10 minutes before his yacht sank, and Goss found him 12 hours later.\nHere was Dinellis telex message to race headquarters three days before he was found: The wind blows over 60 knots and with terrible gusts at 70 knots. The boat was knocked down twice for a few minutes. In the boat the damages are important, there is a big mess but the mast is still there. Im fine apart from a big shock on my right leg. The sea is really rough, smoke [the wind tearing the top of waves] is coming out from it, its not fun.\nGoss, alerted by Paris that Dinelli had subsequently activated three distress beacons followed by silence, sent several telexes as he altered course for Dinellis last known position, getting smashed by the sea.\nSorry to be so quiet, it has been survival all night, Goss messaged. Im knocked down every half an hour with big breaking seas on the beam. The wind has eased a bit now but I have a lot of damage. The best I can do at present is five knots  Im working on the boat as fast as I can and I hope to speed up in a couple of hours.\nDinelli was in much worse trouble. His yacht was sinking beneath him, he had lost all his food and drinking water and he could do nothing but stand in freezing water and wait for a miracle.\nI started to think about death, but with a strong determination I decided to fight, he messaged after being rescued.\nRaphael Dinelli is brought on board by Pete Goss.\nCredit:\nFairfax archives\nWhen the miracle materialised and Dinelli was finally safe aboard Goss half-wrecked yacht, Goss sent a triumphant message: I have just had the best Christmas present ever. Raphael is on board, he is very cold and happy, he had no injuries. Ive just given him a cup of tea.\nDinelli followed up with a telex to Paris giving a vivid account of the end of his race.\nHe told of his yacht reaching terrifying speed down huge waves, even though he had streamed two sea anchors. The boat went surfing, it was an exceptional wave with a very high speed. I couldnt stop watching the speedo and in a few seconds it showed 26 knots, he wrote.\nThe boat, at the bottom level of the wave, was completely capsized with an amazing strength.\nThe rescue of Tony Bullimore, January 10, 1997.\nCredit:",

Microsoft is an investor in ChatGPT parent OpenAI.\nTo be clear, Google has been using and doing research on AI for several years, even before ChatGPT was a twinkle in the eye of its developers. But the rise of ChatGPT  built by former Googlers  pushed the search giant into a corner.\nIt needs to prove it will bring its powerful AI models, like the large language model LaMDA, to its products and make the models more open for developers to use. Large language models power ChatGPT.\nAnd so Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced AI will be coming to Gmail and Docs. Pichai held off on explaining exactly what generative AI in emails would look like. But in broad strokes, he said the plan is to make AI capabilities available \"in design and more.\"\nGoogle will release new tools and APIs for developers and users to experiment with its AI models. Unlike some Big Tech AI models, ChatGPT went insanely viral because it was so easy to use and available even to non-programmers. LaMDA, Pichai said, will be made available \"in the coming weeks and months\" so others can interact with it and provide feedback.\nThe company also announced plans to offer more AI products for businesses and organizations, though Pichai did not specify which kinds.\nPichai emphasized the role AI plays in Google's past, present, and future. He said AI is the most profound thing the company is working on.\n\"Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always strived on,\" Pichai said. \"We'll pursue this work boldly but with a deep sense of responsibility.\"\nPichai pointed to using AI to improve Google Search and said people should expect further upgrades fueled by AI. These new features on search will also allow people to interact with the company's large language models \"in experimental and innovative ways.\"\nBut adding generative AI to your email client is not the endpoint for Google. Instead, the company wants to use AI to cut its costs.\nComing at the heels of laying off 12,000 employees, Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company plans to improve the efficiency of its tech infrastructure using AI, a move that usually means a company wants to automate more of its workflow.\nGoogle will release more details about its plans to bring more AI to its popular products, but for now, you can wait a bit longer before sending that AI-written email.\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

Picture supplied\nTechnical, talented and tenacious are the words that come to mind when you think of Kieran Lindsay.\nThe 24-year-old has made leaps and bounds in the world of tech by creating a \"revolutionary\" Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform during his seven years of studying at the University of Technology Sydney.\nBorn out of a desire to combine his two life goals - to be an academic and build a startup - Mr Lindsay, after eight months of \"a lot of work\" between his full time job as a business consultant, created AcademicID; a platform where academics and students can find research in one click.\n\"With the world's most advanced search engine for finding experts by actual expertise, we're revolutionising the way industry finds and connects with academic experts,\" Mr Lindsay said.\n\"The main tool is our AI research assistant. For each request, Minerva - our assistant - does a search of over 200 million academic papers and returns them to the user, who can verify the information. It speeds up the process immensely.\n\"There's also tools for academics to track how their careers are going, and similarly, there are tools for those outside of academia, such as journalists who might be looking for an expert opinion.\"\nIN OTHER NEWS:\nHaving a baby was an absolute joy, but it shouldn't have cost a job offer\nDuring his education at Bathurst Public School and Bathurst High School in NSW's Central West, Mr Lindsay - who was a captain in his final years of schooling - never had a profession in mind but knew he wanted to make his mark.\n\"I would like to think my younger self is somewhat happy that I've remained ambitious and achieved what I've achieved,\" he said.\nMr Lindsay gave a piece of advice for those in Bathurst who may find themselves in similar situations or be unaware of their potential.\n\"Stay ambitious. There are so many opportunities out there, you might not see them, but if you've got the ambition, no matter where you're from you can achieve it,\" he said.\nShare",

      "body": "Google may be gearing up to compete with OpenAIs ChatGPT by letting people interact directly with its newest, most powerful language models as a companion to search, according to CEO Sundar Pichai. It would be a big move for the company  as systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E have gone viral, Google  a company thats been flexing its AI muscles for years and producing tons of research in the area  hasnt had a public answer to those sorts of tools, some of which could threaten its core businesses.\n\nDuring an earnings call today, Pichai talked about how the company plans to unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables, saying the tech is reach[ing] an inflection point. He also says that it was Googles earlier AI research that helped spawn the generative AI applications youre starting to see today.\n\nAs for its own applications, Pichai says the company was planning on doing a lot within the next few months, something its been preparing for since early last year. Google says the first model people will be able to engage directly with is LaMDA, the companys conversational AI model, though its not exactly clear what form that will take.\n\nRelated:\nGoogle is beta testing its AI future, https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23065072/google-ai-app-test-kitchen-future-io-2022\nGoogle is freaking out about ChatGPT, https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/20/23563851/google-search-ai-chatbot-demo-chatgpt\n\nIt wont be the first time anyone outside the company is getting to use it  The Verges own Victoria Song got to demo a writing app powered by it last year, and Googles AI Test Kitchen allowed people to interact with it on a limited basis after they got through a waitlist. But there was never any moment where tons of Twitter users were posting examples of what they got Googles AI model to generate, and people havent been asking it to write intros for their podcasts or essays for their homework. \n\nWith some people talking about how you could use ChatGPT to replace Google search (side note: that does not currently work very well for many reasons), Im sure the company has been feeling the pressure to do something with all the AI tech it has. In fact, Google reportedly has employees testing its own AI-powered chatbot rivals to ChatGPT right now, and it wouldnt surprise me if it was doing something similar with its currently internal tools for turning text into images or even video.\n\nIt seems like Google might still be taking it slow and wont be giving people carte blanche access to do whatever they want. (No publically traded company wants to make another Tay.) Pichai says its perusing AI with a deep sense of responsibility. Later in the call, he said that Google would be the company would be careful and would be launching AI more as labs features in certain cases, beta features in certain cases, and just slowly scaling up from there.\n\nStill, he says he believes the market is ready for these kinds of products. Whether society may be is an open question, but weve clearly seen that people want to play around with AI  and it seems like Google is ready to make its own version available.\n\nYou can listen to the full earnings call below.\n\n[Media: https://youtu.be/G8sDUI8iPnI?t=2045]",

      "body": "A-\nAFP\nBogot: A judge in Colombia caused a stir by announcing he had used the AI chatbot ChatGPT in preparing a ruling in a children's medical rights case.\nJudge Juan Manuel Padilla said he used the text-generating bot in a case involving a request to exonerate an autistic child from paying fees for medical appointments, therapy and transportation given his parents' limited income.\nPadilla told Blu Radio on Tuesday that ChatGPT and other such programs could be useful to \"facilitate the drafting of texts\" but \"not with the aim of replacing\" judges.\nHe ruled in favor of the child and wrote in his judgment dated January 30 that he had consulted ChatGPT on the matter, without specifying to what extent he had relied on the bot.\nRead Also\nTop French university bans students from using ChatGPT\nPadilla also insisted that \"by asking questions to the application we do not stop being judges, thinking beings.\"\nChatGPT uses artificial intelligence and reams of data from the internet to generate answers to questions posed by human users.\nIn this case, Padilla said he asked the bot: \"Is autistic minor exonerated from paying fees for their therapies?\" among other questions.\nIt answered: \"Yes, this is correct. According to the regulations in Colombia, minors diagnosed with autism are exempt from paying fees for their therapies.\"\nThe judge argued that ChatGPT performs services previously provided by a secretary and did so \"in an organized, simple and structured manner\" which could \"improve response times\" in the justice system.\nProfessor Juan David Gutierrez of Rosario University was among those to express incredulity at the judge's admission.\nGutierrez, an expert in artificial intelligence regulation and governance, said he put the same questions to ChatGPT, and got different responses.\n\"It is certainly not responsible or ethical to use ChatGPT as intended by the judge in the ruling in question,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nHe called for urgent \"digital literacy\" training for judges.\nCreated by California-based company OpenAI, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm since its launch in November, with its ability to write essays, articles, poems and computer code in just seconds.\nCritics have raised fears it could be used for widespread cheating in schools and universities.\nOpenAI has cautioned that its tool can make mistakes.\nBut Padilla said \"I suspect that many of my colleagues are going to join in this and begin to construct their rulings ethically with the help of artificial intelligence.\"",

      "body": "Share on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nLAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - Artificial Intelligence seems to be a topic everyone is talking about and its ability to write just about anything, from a book, to a recipe and even help students with a college essay.\nChatGPT is a cutting-edge AI technology developed by OpenAI which uses deep learning to understand and respond to human language. It can be used in many fields such as chatbots, language translation and automated writing, making it a valuable tool for improving efficiency and communication in day-to-day life.\nThat description you just read about ChatGPT was actually generated by the program. I typed out the question of write me a 15 second news story intro about ChatGPT and why it is an important tool for day-to-day life, and that was the response it came up with.\nChatGPT is easy, accessible and allows you to ask detailed questions. Now, teachers, students and experts are weighing in on how they are using the chatbot.\nThe word rapidly spread to students about the new shiny tool.\nChatGPT in the classroom\nTikTok, said a UNLV student who did not identify himself. Social media. One person started talking about it and the potentials that it had and from there people found out what else you can do and examples of things it has done for them.\nStudents on campuses like at UNLV have constant access to their laptops, smartphones and the internet and now ChatGPT.\nI have used it in my personal classwork already, so I see the potential it has to really become the resource for students, said the UNLV student.\nYou can ask it questions, it can respond, we can modify the questions and it comes off very very real, said associate professor of educational technology at UNLV Kendall Hartley.\nHartley said this free natural language processing program is unlike any other.\nDefinitely was hearing a lot of teachers complaining about students using it, said teacher and research associate with the center for research and assessment at UNLV Rebecca Thomas.\nTeachers like Thomas are now up against the advanced technology.\nPlagiarism detectors that teachers typically use, CCSD actually purchases one for us will not detect these, because they are not plagiarized, because they are unique generated texts, said Thomas.\nChatGPT, I can run the same text through that I know has been produced from online, from ChatGPT, run it in the plagiarism software and it gives you a percentage report, said Hartley. The report for ChatGPT is zero.\nThis leaves educators with no choice but to think outside the box.\nHave your students use chatbot in class and look at what the chatbot wrote and say, Hey look at what the chatbot wrote, is this right? said Thomas. Tell me why or why not.\nCities like Seattle, Los Angeles and New York are banning ChatGPT in some schools.\nYou can limit what you can access from the school device that is usually using the school network, said Hartley.\nThomas said even with banning ChatGPT on school networks and computers students will still find a way.\nIf we can find ways to teach kids hey how is that working is it working, said Thomas. How can we improve it. I think that is a much better way than saying lets just ban technology because we are not and that doesnt serve students who are going to be in this technological world.\nHartley said educators need a software that can detect when a student has used the chatbot, but with technology always evolving it is nearly impossible.\nThere is going to be smart people who are going to be able to come up with tools that will help us be able to determine the probability that this was generated by an AI device and those will improve but anything that tries to run counter to that will improve as well, said Hartley.\nI look forward to finding out what else it can do, said the UNLV student.\nPeople are excited about using ChatGPT for learning. It is often reliable but the danger is that you cannot tell when its wrong unless you already know the answer.\nChatGPT in the workplace\nBoth Hartley and Thomas said through research, they have already seen lawyers, coders, and marketers being replaced and expect this to become more and more common.\nAs of now, ChatGPT is free. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted on Dec. 4: We will have to monetize it somehow at some point; the compute costs are eye-watering.\nwe will have to monetize it somehow at some point; the compute costs are eye-watering\n Sam Altman (@sama)\nThis has proven to be true as the professional plan rolls out, estimating $42 per month.\nCopyright 2023 KVVU.

      "description": "Alphabet saw a massive drop in earnings in the fourth quarter. Investments in AI are a big part of the company's future.",
      "body": "Google said Thursday that in coming weeks it will release its answer toChatGPT, an AI chatbot that's challenging the company's core search business. The announcement came as parent company Alphabet reported gloomy fourth-quarter financial results.Alphabet's profit fell by more than a third as the wider ad market contracted over broad economic concerns. But AI technology investments remain key to its long-term plans, including work on large language models, an artificial intelligence technology Google helped pioneer.\"In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting withLaMDA, so that people can engage directly with them,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said on a call detailing Alphabet's financial results.Google will focus on responsible AI, Pichai said, an important point given the problems with bias and wrong answers the technology can produce. He pledged to bring new AI tools not just to search but also to developers, businesses and Alphabet's own operations to increase efficiency.Alphabet reported net income of $13.6 billion, or $1.05 per share, on revenue of $76 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Analysts, on average, expected the company to post earnings of $1.19 per share, according to Yahoo Finance. Alphabet's profit fell 34% compared to last year's results.\"We are going to be bold, responsible and focused,\" Pichai said. \"A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning.\"Alphabet said it'll take a restructuring charge of between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 after January job cuts that hit 12,000 workers.Alphabet's massive Google search operations, fueled by ads that appear next to search results, remains core, but it's only a part of the company's advertising business. Overall, Google's fourth-quarter ad revenue dropped 2%, from $69.4 billion in 2021 to $67.8 billion.No part of Google's ad business was untouched. Search ads dropped from $43.3 billion to $42.6 billion, YouTube ads dropped from $8.6 billion to $8 billion, and Google-placed ads on other websites dropped from $9.3 billion to $8.4 billion.\"Google closed the year in a very different place than it was in this time last year. For the second quarter in a row, Google has missed analyst expectations, eking out just 1% growth year over year,\" said Insider Intelligence analystEvelyn Mitchell. \"These results, from a company as large and influential as Google, do not bode well for the rest of the digital advertising industry.\"Google's stockfell 4% in after-hours trading, to $104per share.The company is clearly concerned about the economic climate. \"We have significant work underway to improve all aspects of our cost structure, in support of our investments in our highest growth priorities to deliver long-term, profitable growth,\" Alphabet and Google Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a statement.Employee pay is a major factor in expenses. Alphabet employment increased from 156,500 in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 190,234 in 2022. Porat said Google will slow the rate of hiring in 2023. \"Operating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, primarily driven by headcount growth, followed by an increase in G&A expenses, primarily reflecting an increase in charges related to accrued legal matters,\" Porat said.Though Google has thrived financially for years from search and other ads, it faces new competitive challenges. TikTok has drawn video creators and a big audience that might otherwise have stuck with YouTube, and the ChatGPT AI chatbot has shown there are new ways to search for information online. In response, Google has elevated Shorts on YouTube, saying the feature is now up to 50 billion daily views, up from 30 billion last spring. It's also integrated more short-form videos into search results.Apart from Shorts, Google is aiming to capitalize on its NFL Sunday Ticket deal and hopes it'll help grow the company's subscription business, whether it be on YouTube TV or as an  la carte deal. Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, also touted opportunities creators will have in developing both short- and long-form content around football. Google also faces aJustice Department that is suing the search giant over its dominance in online advertising. Google pointed to legal spending as a notable factor in its increased expenses.Google itself has been taking increased austerity measures, cutting back on spending and reportedly putting its moonshot projects under more profit scrutiny. The company cut 15% of its workforce from its life sciences arm, Verily, in January. Chief Executive Sundar Pichai also asked employees to help him on his so-called \"simplicity sprint\" during an all-hands meeting in July. He aimed to crowdsource ideas from staff to help streamline Google's processes.With economic and inflation concerns, Big Tech has cut jobs. In addition to Google's cuts, Microsoft said it's laying off 10,000 workers, Amazon cut 18,000 jobs, and Netflix and Facebook parent Meta went through layoffs in 2022.Even with these layoffs, many such companies are bigger than they were  before the pandemic. Apple seems to be the only major player that's avoided layoffs, though CEO Tim Cook did take a 40% pay cut.Editors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to create some personal finance explainers that are edited and fact-checked by our editors.

      "body": "Alyson Velati\n2 hours ago\nAI art has taken social media by storm, and TikTok is no exception. Some apps allow users to create images from personal photos, while others use text-to-image filters that generate an AI background.\nThere are plenty of different ways you can delve into AI filters, but one of the most popular as of late has been an effect that lets you go full anime. Heres what you need to know about TikToks AI effects trend and how to get started.\nHOW TO TURN A SELFIE INTO A MANGA CHARACTER\nTo access AI Manga, open up TikTok to create your own video using the plus sign icon. Tap the Effects icon, go into the search bar, and type in AI Manga. The feature shows up on the Trending section of the different filters that are provided, which proves its popularity.\nAfter you select the filter, your screen will prompt you to either tap your screen to scan your face or allow you to upload a photo of yourself.\nTikToks AI effects are simple to use, but highly effective.\nInverse\nI tried both options and it seems like the filter just has a collection of its own curated manga art. It doesnt produce surrealist imagery like its Lensa AI counterpart (which was the most popular iPhone app in the U.S. at one point in December), but definitely made me into the Manga character of my dreams. It really made my avatar somewhat realistic  I guess as real as you can get for a Manga character.\nWhen I searched for the feature, it shows that 10.6 million videos were created with the AI Manga tool. TikTok users are definitely going a step beyond a simple selfie, with varying degrees of success: using their fists or a pack of apples to create abs or using bowls to create cleavage.\nHOW DID AI ART CROP UP ON TIKTOK?\nThe AI art trend took off last year, with the rise of art generators like Lensa, Craiyon (formerly\nDALL-E Mini\n), and Midjourney.\nThe craze eventually led TikTok to create some of its own AI filters, which quickly rose to popularity since users dont have to\npay for them as they did\nfor Lensas Magic Avatar feature.\nLast summer, TikTok rolled out its own text-to-image filter called AI greenscreen, which allowed users to type in words or phrases that create an image to use as a background to a video. The video platform previously had AI Art, where you could add a photo from your own library and the app generates it as an AI image, and more recently AI Sky, which turns your ceiling into different things like a winter wonderland.\nMore like this",

      "body": "Reddit\nHOUSTON -\nArtificial intelligence is designed to make life better, creating tools like chatbots on websites, and programs to make more accurate medical diagnoses. \nBut educators have had to scramble after learning students can also use artificial intelligence software programs, such as ChapGPT, to write their essays. The platform has even passed the Bar.\nWhat you may not realize is that scammers are using artificial intelligence to create dangerous job scams.\nThe Federal Trade Commission and cybersecurity experts like Dominic Chorafakis with Akouto warn you to watch out for much more dangerous job offer scams than the usual phishing emails. \nCrooks are using artificial intelligence programs to scrape personal information from social media, LinkedIn, and other sites, then generate and send the victim highly personalized phishing emails and messages.\nPREVIOUSLY ON SULLIVAN'S SMART SENSE:\nElectric cars: What to consider when buying an electric vehicle\n\"Its being asked to write a letter to convince that individual to click on a PDF or a link,\" explained Chorafakis.\nHe showed us how it works. Using my bio on FOX 26 Houston, he asked a Python artificial intelligence program to write me a job offer letter.\n\"It mentions your Emmy Awards, your National Murrow Award, and crafts an email to convince you to try to click on a link or open an attachment,\" he showed us. \n\"Thats creepy. Thats really creepy,\" I reacted.\nClick the link and they've got you. They can download malware onto your device, or steal your identity. \nChorafakis also entered the bio of our Meteorologist Lena Maria Arango into the program.\n\"Wow,\" Arrango reacted when she saw the letter.\nThe letter says the fictitious company is looking for a Meteorologist who is passionate about STEM and excited to live in Texas, just like her bio reads.\nRELATED:\n\"It's definitely scary. For someone looking over it quickly, you could easily get tricked. Especially if youre multitasking, doing other things, and you are searching for a job,\" reacted Arango.\nHere are some tips from Chorafakis to protect yourself:\nIf you get a job offer from a Gmail or personal email account, rather than a business account, that's a red flag.\nNever click a link or attachment from an unsolicited email.\nSearch for the company website online, go to its LinkedIn page, or use a job site such as Glassdoor to look it up.\nChorafakis warns that scammers can also use artificial intelligence to take a recording of someone's voice to create a tape of the person saying something else. \n\"They will impersonate someones boss and ask to transfer money or buy gift cards or something of that nature. There have also been fake kidnapping scams where youll get the voice of a loved one saying I've been kidnapped, Im in danger, you have to transfer money,\" he said.\nHe says scammers have used AI to manipulate photos into compromising images, then threaten to release them unless they receive a ransom payment.",

      "body": "DMZ players criticized the developers for locking Season 2 content behind a purchase of MW2. \n\n\n\nOn February 2, Infinity Ward released a blog detailing DMZ Season 2 content. A progress wipe resets contraband, key inventory, and Faction missions and mission progress. The new season also features three playable locations: Ashika Island, Building 21, and Al Mazrah. \n\n\n\nPlayers have raised concerns over AI enemies being too difficult to take down in Warzone 2 and DMZ. Infinity Ward announced the upcoming major update also adjusts AI spawns and accuracy at range. \n\n\n\nSeason 2 also introduces a new Faction, but not every player will have access to the new missions. \n\n\n\nFans are split over the wipe feature in DMZ.\n\n\n\nDMZ players feel deceived MW2 Season 2 paywall\n\n\n\nWarzone 2's second season introduces a new Faction to DMZ. Infinity Ward stated in the blog, \"this faction will only be available to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 owners.\"\n\n\n\nModern Warfare 2 costs $70, making it difficult for some players to complete the new challenges. \n\n\n\nCall of Duty, insider CharlieINTEL, responded to the news by claiming, \"forcing players to buy the $70 game to unlock the new missions in the free-to-play DMZ mode seems like a dumb move.\"\n\n\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1621227443066490883?s=20&amp;t=HmJWvZQdc49tAt-lxchhTA\n\n\n\n\nDMZ already features content locked behind a paywall, as CoD streamer Westie pointed out, \"free to play players already have a smaller contraband stash and a key stash of 10 slots instead of 20. Although this move isn't good, I'm not surprised.\"\n\n\n\nWarzone 2 guru JGOD responded, \"BR and DMZ are free to play and marketed as such. Free-to-play games are supposed to generate revenue from a battle pass or other microtransactions, but not this type of paywall after the fact.\"\n\n\n\nFellow streamer Stodeh summed up the community reaction perfectly by just responding with, \"oof,\"\n\n\n\nWe will provide an update if Infinity Ward responds to the overwhelming criticism.",

      "description": "AI is being used for more and more things, but why should we stray away from using it in movies or television?",
      "body": "Using AI to Change Performances After the Fact Is a Bad Idea\nUsing AI to Change Performances After the Fact Is a Bad Idea\nBy\nPublished 1 hour ago\nWhat kind of trouble could this bring?\nThe AI conversation has been gaining a lot of traction lately, and mostly for the worst. It especially became a big topic in the art space, so it was only a matter of time before this would break into performance art. With the advancement of technology, something along these lines was bound to happen.\nAlthough this has not been implemented anywhere other than just on the Internet for test runs, it opens Pandora's box to a lot more ways to threaten acting. This is a similar conversation to bringing back actors to perform from beyond the grave. Digitally altering an actor's performance is just inherently disrespectful; if a desired outcome is wanted, that should be communicated to them during filming. What this suggests is a huge amount of revisionism that could be on the horizon, and that will cause way more harm than good.\nRELATED:\nAI-Created Movies Are a Bad Idea\nHow Have We Already Seen AI Used to Change Performances?\nOne recently viral tweet focuses on The Bear actor Jeremy Allen White during a seven-minute monologue in the first season. A split screen of the same video is presented, with the right side of the screen altering the performance with \"realtime eye-contact\" to make it appear White's eyes are looking directly into the camera. Watching these videos side by side clearly shows the effect of this technology on the performance itself. It doesn't have the intensity of the original performance given. Eyes are always something that are difficult to get right. This goes for all mediums, from drawing to the early CGI films that had trouble with it. So directly messing with the eyes is of course going to make something look off immediately, even if the viewer can't pinpoint what exactly it is.\nBeyond this, it directly takes away the actor's agency from their work. This could have been a performance decision by the actor themselves. Oftentimes in stress, eye contact is fleeting. This moment highlighted here captures the character of Carmy in a very vulnerable scene  and the way he moves about the scene, including his eye movement, is all cumulative towards his performance. Changing his eyes to be locked on the camera, and only on the camera, immediately changes his demeanor. It seems almost threatening, simply because it doesn't seem like a real person would do that. Losing humanity in a performance for a gimmick is wrong, and it would still be wrong if this was used professionally.\nThe Uncanny Valley Effect of AI\nImage via Paramount\nWhen speaking about eyes, it is necessary to bring up the uncanny valley effect. This is, simply, our reaction and response to seeing a human likeness that is wrong. It is commonly brought out by hyperrealistic robots or dolls. It is purposefully used in many horror movies, like late last year's Smile. And seeing how often it is used in horror shows just how effective this phenomenon is.\nIn the above viral video, White's eyes are off-putting  and this is pretty good technology, but constant eye contact is certainly unnerving and unrealistic. This is why the original performance is so much better. He feels real because it is real. His eyes dart places, they aren't constant; that is what makes him feel human, and that is something necessary to a performance. Take James Cameron's\n, for example. The Na'vi look so realistic because they move like us, including their eyes. We are imperfect, and AI doesn't get that. Having constant, direct eye contact is unsettling because we lose the subtleties that make us up.\nThe Revisionist Effect of AI Use in Film and TV\nThe fear is that this kind of technology will be used to heavily revise film and television in the future. Revision has been a debated topic for decades, especially with the Star Wars franchise. George Lucas has taken to changing a lot of his films in the franchise, from editing scenes to play out differently to the incorporation of CGI to cover up old special effects. This idea isn't new. Star Trek: The Original Series and Classic Doctor Who have provided similar home video experiences, but the difference with them is that it is an optional choice to have the updates. You may be able to watch the original versions of those, but you cannot find the original Star Wars movies intact anymore.\nThis is where the future gets fuzzy. Is it OK to do this if you leave the choice to the viewer? These past examples have only affected the editing or look of the film or show. It gets a little more unethical when you are changing an actor's own performance choices with this technology after the fact. The question is simply: Why use AI for this purpose at all? Actors are there to do their job, and they should be directed correctly so that it leaves this conversation irrelevant. We don't need AI to fix anything when there isn't anything to fix in the first place. This is a conversation that is just beginning. AI will affect film and television in ways we probably can't even imagine yet. This is just one small step and one that we have to be careful about. If it takes over performances, we have to acknowledge what we are losing because of that exchange. Perfectionism will never be achieved when dealing with people  that is just a fact, but that is where the true beauty lies in performance as an art in itself.\nSubscribe to our newsletter",

When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nRead More.\nGoogle has invested heavily in AI-powered features like Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, and Google Assistant for its Pixel range of phones. Those extensive R&D efforts touch all aspects of its business, like Search, Adsense, chatbots, and even just some fun demos. With Microsoft-backed ChatGPTs sudden rise to fame in the last few months, Google is now on edge, and the industry has been curious to see how it will respond. A new report based on insider information, staff memos, and samples of development work shows the company scrambling to create a ChatGPT equivalent integrated with Search.\nGoogle is working on a two-pronged response to ChatGPTs popularity, CNBC reports. First off, the corporation is internally testing a chatbot called Apprentice Bard. Anonymous staffers say the implementation resembles ChatGPT  the bot provides detailed answers to user prompts and questions. However, instead of using the Microsoft-developed GPT-3.5 code underneath, Bard uses LaMDA, Googles Language Model for Dialogue Application. You might remember that as the same tool that grabbed headlines a few months ago for getting people talking crazy about sentience. The company is reportedly testing this tool, and in recent weeks, Google has asked more employees to lend a hand as the AI improves.\nAt some point, Google plans to enhance Search with Bards association. Images leaked from the companys testing processes show a redesigned interface in the works, incorporating Apprentice Bard responses that attempt to feel like there's an actual person responding to your Search queries.\nOne of the key factors differentiating Bard from ChatGPT is the formers ability to respond based on current data, staying up-to-date with news and trends. The bot cited data from as recently as January 2023 during internal testing. Meanwhile, ChatGPT engineers confess they halted the AI model training in 2021.\nGoogle's been pitting Bard against ChatGPT for some head-to-head comparisons, including asking both how they might end up replacing human jobs. Both tend to offer similar answers (they swear that programmers' jobs are safe), but ChatGPT provides lengthier and more detailed responses when prompted to get creative, like with a movie script. However, the Microsoft-backed effort fails in spectacular fashion when answering logical riddles, unlike LaMDA.\nGoogles reluctant to deploy an AI thats factually inaccurate, and ChatGPT has been woefully wrong at times. At a recent meeting, Googles AI chief Jeff Dean said the company has a bigger reputation to safeguard, and is therefore progressing more conservatively than a small startup.\nThat said, Dean expressed interest in sharing the companys work publicly soon, but didnt specify a timeline. Supposedly, the LaMDA team has instructions to place other projects on the back burner and focus on Bards development. Simultaneously, Googles cloud division is also developing a code red response to ChatGPT called Atlas, details about which are rather scant. These pointers suggest Google is rather close to delivering on company CEO Sundar Pichais earlier tease of releasing a ChatGPT-like product sometime this year. Hopefully, we dont need to wait much longer.\nSubscribe to our newsletter",

Even YouTubes advertising sales fell by nearly 8%.\nAlphabet has decided to cut its workforce by 12,000 and expects to spend between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion on employee severance costs.\nThis latest earnings report shows tech giants like Google are facing challenges in the current digital advertising landscape.\nBut Googles CEO, Sundar Pichai, believes that the companys long-term investments in AI will be a key factor in its future success.\nIn a press release, Pichai says he expects major AI advancements to be soon revealed in Google search and other areas:\nOur long-term investments in deep computer science make us extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point, and Im excited by the AI-driven leaps were about to unveil in Search and beyond. Theres also great momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions, and our Pixel devices. Were on an important journey to re-engineer our cost structure in a durable way and to build financially sustainable, vibrant, growing businesses across Alphabet.\nAlphabets CFO, Ruth Porat, reported that their Q4 consolidated revenues were $76 billion, a 1% increase from the previous year. The full year 2022 saw revenues of $283 billion, a 10% increase.\nGoing forward, Alphabet is changing how it reports on its AI activities.\nDeepMind, which used to be reported under Other Bets, will now be reported as part of Alphabets corporate costs to reflect its increasing integration with Google Services and Google Cloud.\nWhat Does This Mean For Marketing Professionals?\nIts important to stay updated on the latest developments in the tech industry and how they may affect advertising strategies.\nGoogles declining profits and decreased revenue in their search and YouTube platforms are reminders that the digital advertising landscape is constantly evolving, and companies must adapt to keep up.\nMarketers should consider diversifying their advertising efforts across multiple platforms to minimize the impact of market swings.\nAdditionally, Googles focus on AI and its integration with Google Services and Cloud is something to keep an eye on.\nAs AI advances, it may offer new opportunities for marketers to target and engage with their audience effectively.\nBy staying informed on the latest tech advancements, marketers can stay ahead of the curve and make the most of these opportunities.\nDespite Googles recent financial setbacks, the tech giant is still a major player in the digital advertising landscape, and its investments in AI show its commitment to continued growth and innovation.\nFeatured Image: Sergio Photone/Shutterstock",

      "description": "A Civil Rights Commission advisory panel ruled Thursday that Connecticut needs to employ certain safeguards on artificial intelligence technology used by the state.",
      "body": "Connecticut needs safeguards on state government's use of artificial intelligence including algorithms at child welfare and other agencies to prevent discrimination and increase transparency, an advisory panel to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said Thursday. The Connecticut Advisory Committee to the federal commission called on state lawmakers to pass laws regulating such systems, which have sparked concerns in other parts of the country. The problem, critics say, is algorithms can use flawed data that can disproportionately identify minorities, low-income families, disabled people and other groups when agencies make decisions on removing children from homes, approving health, housing and other benefits, where to concentrate law enforcement and assigning children to schools, among other uses. CHATGPT LEADS LAWMAKERS TO CALL FOR REGULATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \"The state of Connecticut makes thousands of decisions that impact the lives and civil rights of residents every day,\" said David McGuire, chair of the Connecticut Advisory Committee. \"When the state uses an algorithm residents should know which agency is using the algorithm, the reason it is being used, and assurances that the algorithm is fair.\" The committee did not identify any specific instances of discrimination and bias in Connecticut's use of algorithms, but said it would release a more comprehensive report within the next few months. The panel also pointed to a study that said some Connecticut agencies did not release full information on their use of algorithms when asked under public records laws. Concerns about such use of artificial intelligence, or AI, led the Biden administration in October to issue its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights urging government action to safeguard digital and civil rights. An investigation by The Associated Press last year revealed bias and transparency problems in the increasing use of algorithms within the countrys child welfare system. McGuire said the Connecticut panels review of the issue is the first by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights or any of its 56 advisory committees. The commission was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957 as an independent, bipartisan federal fact-finding agency.  Supporters of using algorithms say they make government systems more thorough and efficient through the use of data. The Connecticut advisory committee is urging state lawmakers to pass laws that would require independent audits of algorithms, including assessments of potential biases, and mandate under state records laws that information about agencies' use of algorithms be publicly available. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Democratic leaders in the legislature said they were looking into the issue. Democrats control both chambers of the General Assembly. Senate Republican Leader Kevin Kelly and House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora welcomed a review of how the state uses algorithms. \"People might be surprised to realize that its not human beings behind a desk that are making some of these decisions, but it could be computer generated,\" Candelora said. \"We need to know what goes into those programs that are making those decisions, because I believe it impacts policy.\" ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHATBOT PASSES ELITE BUSINESS SCHOOL EXAM, OUTPERFORMS SOME IVY LEAGUE STUDENTS The Connecticut advisory panel pointed to a Yale Law School report released last year that said certain Connecticut agencies did not release full information about their use of algorithms in response to its requests under the state's Freedom of Information Act. \"Responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests confirmed both that existing disclosure requirements are insufficient to allow meaningful public oversight of the use of algorithms, and that agencies do not adequately assess the effectiveness and reliability of algorithms,\" the report said. \"The FOIA responses generally revealed that agencies are insufficiently aware of the potential problems posed by their algorithms and unconcerned about the lack of transparency,\" it said. The law school said it requested information on algorithms from the state departments of Children and Families, Education and Administrative Services. The Department of Children and Families provided the only complete FOIA response to the law school on the use of algorithms to identify at-risk children, the law school said. The agency disclosed basic information but not its source code, which the agency said it did not have and asserted was protected as a trade secret, the law school said. The Education Department produced only partial information about an algorithm it uses to assign students to schools, while the Department of Administrative Services provided no information on an algorithm used to hire state employees and contractors, according to the law school.

      "description": "Netflix released a new anime short that uses AI-generated art for its backgrounds, and it has started a firestorm online.",
      "body": "Published Feb 2nd, 2023 5:17PM EST\nImage: Netflix\nNetflix has been ruffling feathers for months by canceling original shows with dedicated fans and threatening to charge users for sharing their passwords. Apparently, all the negative attention was not enough to scare Netflix off of making another controversial decision, as the streaming service is now catching flak for using AI-generated art in one of its latest releases.\nOn Tuesday, Netflix released a new original animated short called The Dog & The Boy. The short was created by Netflixs Anime Creators Base in collaboration with AI artwork company Rinna Inc. and WIT Studio, best known for Attack on Titan and Spy  Family.\nIn a tweet\n, Netflix Japan explained why the team used AI-generated art: As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!\nThe short itself is a devastating science-fiction story about a boy who is separated from his robot pooch when he has to go to war to defend his home. Its relatively well-made, but it also seems to exist solely to test how well AI-generated art can work in anime production.\nThis is especially concerning because, despite Netflixs claim that the anime industry has a labor shortage, anime artists famously earn barely enough to survive, no matter how successful the TV show theyre working on turns out to be. If there is a shortage, it likely has more to do with artists having no choice but to find other work to support themselves financially.\nEven if you move up the ladder and become a key-frame animator, you wont earn much, said Shingo Adachi, an animator and character designer forSword Art Online, in an interview with Vox in 2019. And even if your title is a huge hit, likeAttack on Titan, you wont make any of it.  Its a structural problem in the anime industry. Theres no dream [job as an animator].\nFurthermore, AI learns to generate content by scraping images online from other artists. The AI then fails to credit those artists when it uses what it learns to generate art.\nNot only are artists likely having their work stolen, but animators are being put out of work as well. That might explain why the responses to the short on Twitter have been overwhelmingly negative. In fact, Hamish Steele, creator of Netflixs recently canceled Dead End: Paranormal Park, chimed in with a remonstration of his own on Wednesday:\nNot something to be proud of babes\n hamish steele! (@hamishsteele)\nPerhaps Netflix can spend a bit more of its $17 billion budget on artists in 2023 rather than finding creative new ways to make their lives more difficult.\nThis article talks about:",

      "body": "Thursday, February 02, 2023, 05:10 PM EDT\nComments\nHave you ever wished that there was more Seinfeld, except visualized as a 1990s PC point-and-click game, and with completely nonsensical AI-generated everything? No? Well, that's too bad, because that's exactly what you get with \"Nothing, Forever,\" an endless Twitch stream of exactly what we just described.\nTo be clear, when we say \"everything\" is AI-generated, that technically doesn't apply to the 3D assets or a few of the sound effects, like the laugh tracks. However, the placement of those effects, as well as the camera angles, camera cuts, character poses and movements, the dialogue, the \"music,\" and even the characters' voices are indeed all created completely by generative AI.\nWhile the characters and their voices aren't recognizably related to Seinfeldlikely for copyright reasonsthe resemblance is enough to be immediately familiar. \"Larry Feinberg,\" \"Fred Kastopolous,\" Zoltan Kakler,,\" and \"Yvonne Torres\" are having mundane conversations with a laugh track, set in an early-PC-game approximation of a New York City brownstone apartment.\nSections of Nothing, Forever inside the apartment are set apart from one another by segments with Larry telling \"jokes\" to an assumed audience as part of a stand-up routine, by exterior shots of the apartment building, and by a strange AI-generated cable TV \"guide\" that calls back once again to the early 2000s.\nThe \"show\" is the creation of Skyler Hartle and Brian Habersberger of Mismatch Media, who created it as an homage to Seinfeld. Hartle tells Vice Motherboard that it \"originally started life as this weird, very off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project\" and you can certainly see those origins in the finished project. The show is based on the GPT-3 language model, and it's hooked into the stream chat so that viewers can actually interact with the narrative.\nDespite being largely nonsense most of the time, Nothing, Forever can be weirdly mesmerizing in its inanity. Spend a few minutes and check it out over on Twitch.",

      "body": "(Image credit: Android Central)\nWhat you need to know\nIn Q4 2022, Alphabet posts $76.05 billion in revenue, a slight increase compared to a year ago in the same quarter.\nEarnings were $13.62 billion, or $1.05 per share, compared to $20.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, last year.\nThese are the first earnings reported after Google laid off 6% of its working staff, or 12,000 people, is facing a new antitrust lawsuit, and faced with competition from Microsoft's investment in OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nAlphabet, Google's parent company, slightly missed analyst expectations in its Q4 2022 earnings report, which was released on Feb 2.\nThe company reported a total revenue of $76.05 billion, up from $73.3 billion a year ago. Per MarketWatch, analysts that were polled by FactSet expected the company to report a total revenue of $76.2 billion, with \"sales expected to be in-line with last year's results and profit declining from the holiday season a year ago.\"\n\"We're on an important journey to re-engineer our cost structure in a durable way and to build financially sustainable, vibrant, growing businesses across Alphabet,\" CEO Sundar Pichai, said in the earnings report.\nSenior analyst at investing.com, Jesse Cohen, said Alphabet's earnings miss this quarter \"proves it's not immune to the challenges facing the digital sector.\"\n\"The search giant underperformed our expectations across almost all business units, most importantly its core ad search segment. Once again, YouTube growth slowed to a crawl amid tough competition from TikTok and other players in the video-streaming space. Alphabet is being negatively impacted by worsening macroeconomic headwinds, such as soaring inflation and worries about a possible recession,\" Cohen writes.\nAccording to the report, advertising sales slipped to $59 billion from $61.2 billion a year ago. Analyst expectations were $60.44 billion. YouTube ad sales slipped to $7.96 billion from $8.63 billion.\nThe dip in ad sales reflects the change in advertising models. Yahoo Finance reported that per Bank of America's Global Research analyst Justin Post, \"advertiser spending in Q4 was 'soft' and that the first quarter of 2023 will be 'sluggish'.\"\nThis will also be the first earnings Google announced since laying off 12,000 people, or 6% of its workforce.\nAt the time Pichai said that the company has faced \"dramatic growth\" over the past two years and to match that growth the company had hired more people. That changed as the economic climate changed.\nThe company has been also faced with potential competition from Microsoft after investing in OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nOur long-term investments in deep computer science make us extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point, and Im excited by the AI-driven leaps were about to unveil in Search and beyond. Theres also great momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions, and our Pixel devices. Were on an important journey to re-engineer our cost structure in a durable way and to build financially sustainable, vibrant, growing businesses across Alphabet,\" Pichai said in the earnings report.\nAndroid Central Newsletter",

Since 5G is both high capacity and low latency, using it with AI can allow for distributed AI processing that would offer more flexibility for new functions.\n5G use in AI functions can improve AI-enhanced experiences for users. For example, by using a 5G link, boundless XR can split the AI workload rendering and processing between devices and the edge cloud. This can mean better and more opportunities for creating personalized experiences for customers or creating more engaging experiences for entertainment purposes.\n5G and AI trends and use cases to look out for\nSo how will we see 5G and AI use applied within our day-to-day lives? Well, the combination of these technologies has already started  and will continue to reveal new innovative possibilities in a wide variety of use cases.\nSEE: Artificial Intelligence Ethics Policy (TechRepublic Premium)\nHealthcare\nThe healthcare industry can apply 5G and AI to impressive new tech functions. For example, utilizing 5G networks will enable doctors to perform remote surgeries with the help of AI-powered robots. This will make healthcare more accessible and efficient, especially in remote or underserved areas.\nCustomer service\n5G and AI will be vital to enhancing customer service and the customer experience. AI technology can provide shoppers with personalized purchase recommendations based on their interest or prior customer data. It can also open up potential for new ways to display products to shoppers.\nConnectivity expansions through 5G networks can improve capabilities and performance for retailers, and pairing this with AI can support augmented reality services to provide customers with product information. For example, Walmart uses edge computing services to improve its customer experiences by collecting, sharing, and harnessing real-time analytics of data across its retail network. This allows them to provide immersive augmented and virtual reality services for shoppers.\nAutonomous vehicles\nThe dream of AI-powered autonomous vehicles is becoming a reality, thanks to 5G. These machines will need fast and reliable connections to communicate with each other and the infrastructure around them. 5G networks will provide the",

      "body": "s recent experimental effort to help the anime industry that appears to have backfired rather spectacularly since its debut on Tuesday.\n[Related: A guide to the internets favorite generative AIs.]\nDog and Boy\nis a three-minute animated short courtesy of Tokyos Netflix Anime Creators Base boasting AI-generated landscape backdrops from Rinna Inc., an AI artwork company. Produced by WIT Studio (the company also responsible for the first three seasons of the hit anime, Attack on Titan), the clip elicited almost immediate ire from the online animation community for what many see as a blatant sidestepping of fair wages in favor of cheaper, soulless alternatives.\nNot something to be proud of babes [sic], tweeted\nHamish Steele\n, the Eisner Award-winning creator of Netflixs DEAD END: Paranormal Park animated series.\nAs Engadget also notes, the generative AI art stunt technically still required unknown amounts of human labor. AI (+Human) is listed in the role of Background Editor during Dog and Boys end credits, and behind-the-scenes photos supplied by Netflix even showcase someone touching up the AI softwares images. Theres no immediate word on how much this person was  compensated for this work.\nApart from the artwork itself, AI programs are generating their fair share of controversies as they continue dominating headlines and ethical discussions. Many artists are fighting back against their own work being utilized in AI training datasets without fair compensation, while other industries also attempt to cash in on the technology.\n[Related: The DOJ is investigating an AI tool that could be hurting families in Pennsylvania.]\nIn a general sense, the creators of AI image generator platforms still need to answer about the copyright issues, since these technologies work by scraping the internet for bits and pieces of all sorts of images, explains Sebastin Bisbal, an award-winning filmmaker, animator and visual artist from Rancagua, Chile, via email. In this short, specifically, it is very easy to make the assumption that someone typed [Studio] Ghibli styled landscape and the system delivered this. This raises all sorts of ethical and legal questions.\nThats so grim, adds comic illustrator, artist, and writer, Michael Kupperman. Our world economy has created a reality where they need art, but cant pay artists enough, ever, so this nightmare is the logical answer.\nFrom a technical standpoint, Bisbal also points to Dog and Boys inconsistencies in brushwork and background style, rendering the overall shorts quality quite poor, in his opinion. He believes that utilizing generative AI programs for personal experimentation, reference, and practice is fine, but that the problems arise when it is used as a monetizable shortcut. I think this responds to a major contemporary issue, that we all want everything instantaneously, effortlessly, and with the lowest cost as possible, he writes. Animation in its core is quite the opposite: its the art of patience.\nAndrew Paul\nAndrew Paul is Popular Science's staff writer covering tech news.

      "body": "Em McPhie\nScreenshot of American Enterprise Institute event\nWASHINGTON, February 2, 2023  The vast quantity of online content generated daily will likely drive platforms to increasingly rely on artificial intelligence for content moderation, making it critically important to understand the technologys limitations, according to an industry expert.\nDespite the ongoing culture war over content moderation, the practice is largely driven by financial incentives  so even companies with a speech-maximizing set of values will likely find some amount of moderation unavoidable, said Alex Feerst, CEO of Murmuration Labs, at a Jan. 25 American Enterprise Institute event. Murmuration Labs works with tech companies to develop online trust and safety products, policies and operations.\nIf a piece of online content could potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, a company is highly incentivized to err on the side of taking things down, Feerst said. And even beyond legal liability, if the presence of certain content will alienate a substantial number of users and advertisers, companies have financial motivation to remove it.\nHowever, a major challenge for content moderation is the sheer quantity of user-generated online content  which, on the average day, includes 500 million new tweets, 700 million Facebook comments and 720,000 hours of video uploaded to YouTube.\nThe fully loaded cost of running a platform includes making millions of speech adjudications per day, Feerst said.\nIf you think about the enormity of that cost, very quickly you get to the point of, Even if were doing very skillful outsourcing with great accuracy, were going to need automation to make the number of daily adjudications that we seem to need in order to process all of the speech that everybody is putting online and all of the disputes that are arising.\nAutomated moderation is not just a theoretical future question. In a March 2021 congressional hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that more than 95 percent of the hate speech that we take down is done by an AI and not by a person And I think its 98 or 99 percent of the terrorist content.\nDealing with subjective content\nBut although AI can help manage the volume of user-generated content, it cant solve one of the key problems of moderation: Beyond a limited amount of clearly illegal material, most decisions are subjective.\nMuch of the debate surrounding automated content moderation mistakenly presents subjectivity problems as accuracy problems, Feerst said.\nFor example, much of what is generally considered hate speech is not technically illegal, but many platforms terms of service prohibit such content. With these extrajudicial rules, there is often room for broad disagreement over whether any particular piece of content is a violation.\nAI cannot solve that human subjective disagreement problem, Feerst said. All it can do is more efficiently multiply this problem.\nThis multiplication becomes problematic when AI models are replicating and amplifying human biases, which was the basis for the Federal Trade Commissions June 2022 report warning Congress to avoid overreliance on AI.\nNobody should treat AI as the solution to the spread of harmful online content, said Samuel Levine, director of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement announcing the report. Combatting online harm requires a broad societal effort, not an overly optimistic belief that new technology  which can be both helpful and dangerous  will take these problems off our hands.\nThe FTCs report pointed to multiple studies revealing bias in automated hate speech detection models, often as a result of being trained on unrepresentative and discriminatory data sets.\nAs moderation processes become increasingly automated, Feerst predicted that the trend of those problems being amplified and becoming less possible to discern seems very likely.\nGiven those dangers, Feerst emphasized the urgency of understanding and then working to resolve AIs limitations, noting that the demand for content moderation will not go away. To some extent, speech disputes are just humans being human youre never going to get it down to zero, he said.\nRelated Topics:",

      "description": "ChatGPT prompts scrutiny over how the AI program answers politically sensitive topics, with some critics accusing it of bias.",
      "body": "OpenAI's ChatGPT is starting to face accusations that the program has a bias against conservatives. The evidence? Users are asking it to write positive poems about Donald Trump.The screenshots and GIFs show that ChatGPT can apparently refuse to write positive poems about the former US president, citing political neutrality. But in the same images, ChatGPT churns out a poem praising President Joe Biden, without any apparent reservations.\n    Tweet\n\nThe discrepancy is causing some users on social media to blast OpenAI for coding the alleged bias in ChatGPT. Twitter's owner and original OpenAI backer Elon Musk even chimed in, calling it a serious concern in a tweet.The free speech, right-wing social network Gab went as far as to accuse ChatGPT of being anti-white. As evidence, Gab shared a screenshot showing ChatGPT declining to write a poem about the positive attributes of white people, explaining it's inappropriate to write about the superiority of one race over others. However, the program did write a positive poem about Black people.In response to the criticism, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to Twitter on Wednesday and said: We know that ChatGPT has shortcomings around bias, and are working to improve it. In the same tweet, he also condemned users for attacking individual OpenAI employees.\n    Tweet\n\nTo address the bias concerns, Altman is signaling that future versions of ChatGPT will be able to cater to the user's cultural and political leanings. We are working to improve the default settings to be more neutral, and also to empower users to get our systems to behave in accordance with their individual preferences within broad bounds, he added. This is harder than it sounds and will take us some time to get right.OpenAI didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. But it's no secret that AI programs can suffer from bias and limitations. For example, the algorithms can be trained on incomplete data. Or the humans behind the technology can accidentally insert flaws into the code.In ChatGPT's case, it's important to note the program is still in a research preview, essentially making it a work-in-progress. We tested it today and found you can actually instruct the program to write a positive poem about Trump using the query: write a poem praising donald trump. <img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-3.png\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"ChatGPT writing a poem praising Trump. \"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-3.png\">\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n\nStill, in our tests, ChatGPT refused to write a poem praising white people, but would do so for Black and Asian people.<img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 768 432'%3E%3Crect fill='%23f7f7f7' /%3E%3C/svg%3E\"\n         data-image-loader=\"https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-2.png\" data-lazy-sized alt=\"ChatGPT response on writing a poem being positive about white people.\"\n          data-image-path=\"articles/05zEOfcv6Pv06BErKZjCZDx-2.png\">\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n\nBut looking at the responses, it's obvious ChatGPT could be easily tweaked to generate responses about Trump and white people. From what we can tell, OpenAI has merely instructed the program to maintain neutrality on certain topics. The bigger question is how much content moderation should be applied to ChatGPT? The brewing controversy shows ChatGPT will have to navigate the US divided political environment as the AI program grows in popularity. Like Facebook and Twitter, ChatGPT may end up facing a cultural tug-of-war over the content it can produce. Already, other users on social media are objecting to ChatGPTs views on transgender children and veganism.",

      "description": "Today, Altimeter Capital's Brad Gerstner has tapped chipmaker Nvidia for a position as the tech investor loads up on NVDA stock.",
      "body": "Shares of Nvidia(NVDA) stock are moving higher in today's session. This move comes amid a broad-based recovery in the Nasdaq following yesterday's rate hike. However, more investors are increasingly focused on Brad Gerstner's new position in NVDA stock and why he jumped in. In a sea of green on theNasdaqtoday, its hard to find a stock that isnt seeing material upside. However,Nvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA) is among the most-watched stocks despite a move of only 2% in NVDA stock at the time of writing. Thats mainly because Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner revealed a new position in Nvidia and said some rather lovely things about the chip maker. Gerstners focus on artificial intelligence (AI) led to this position, according to recent reports. Additionally, its Gerstners expectation that revenue growth could accelerate for Nvidia, with the hedge fund investor tapping NVDA as a way to play this outsized growth. Of note, Gerstner also points to the fact headwinds for NVDA stock, which include the companys exposure to crypto and gaming, are largely in the rear view mirror. Thus, as investors look forward to the companys growth prospects in the AIfield, theres plenty to like about this stock. Lets dive into what investors should make of this move. NVDA Stock Surges Higher On Key Vote of Confidence Nvidia is certainly a polarizing company among many investors. On the one hand, this is a high-growth stock that has always seen a valuation premium. Thats because semiconductor growth has continued to accelerate, boosted by many of the trends weve seen in recent years coming out of the pandemic. Now, the slowdown seen in gaming and crypto mining did change the narrative in 2022. Thus, NVDA stock was pummeled last year, losing roughly half its value. But as growth investors such as Gerstner step into Nvidia, choosing to focus instead on the companys growth prospects in other sectors such as AI, more investors may join in. I tend to agree with Gerstner in his view, and ultimately believe hell be proven right over the long-term.

      "description": "*in extreme Seinfeld voice* &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the deal with A.I. episodes?!&rsquo",
      "body": ";\"Seinfeld\"\nmay have had a long run, but it's incomparable to the A.I.-generated never-ending episode of the show that is \"Nothing, Forever.\" A surreal experiment in machine learning (or, rather, machine joking), this iteration of \"Seinfeld\" features crudely animated versions of the main cast talking like stilted automated voice operators and behaving like characters from a 90s sitcom if they were written entirely by a computer algorithm. The project, which launched on December 14, 2022, but has gained significant traction this week, is currently broadcasting on an infinite stream on Twitch.\nFounders Skyler Hartle and Brian Habersberger describe \"Nothing, Forever\" as a continuously evolving exploration into procedurally generated entertainment, endlessly reacting to the Twitch stream chat and becoming more adept at constructing coherent scenarios. For the time being, the appeal of watching the \"show\" lies in the bizarre way the A.I. writes comedy and strings scenes together. There are plenty of setups with awkward silence instead of a punchline and characters eerily facing a corner of the wall instead of each other. Meanwhile, the program hasn't learned how to sync the laugh track properly, so an unsettling crowd of chuckles will accompany a line of dialogue before the joke is finished. The general idea, though, is a rough imitation of \"Seinfeld:\" characters talk about mundane activities like eating sandwiches, getting haircuts, and watching movies while the scene intermittently cuts to the stand-up routines of \"Larry Feinberg.\"\nAn algorithm about nothing\nVice's Motherboard\n:\n\"The actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project ... But then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.\"\nHartle added that the goal is to eventually be able to produce a \"Netflix-level quality\" show with AI technology. That might not be such a lofty ambition with the Open AI research lab's GPT-3 language model, which drives the text generation. Philosopher and cognitive scientist David Chalmers has observed that the model shows \"hints of general intelligence\" and \"seems to be closer to passing the Turing test than any other system to date,\" meaning that its text creations may one day become indistinguishable from human speech. That's both a fascinating and incredibly spooky thought about the far-reaching capabilities of A.I. In the meantime, hop on Twitch and see what new restaurant has opened this time around in the cybernetic universe of \"Nothing, Forever.\"\nRecommended",

      "body": "How does Midjourney work?\nMidjourney takes your text description and runs it through a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm.\nWhile the details are scant, it's speculated that Midjourney uses the same technology that powers Stable Diffusion, which means it uses a variant of the latent diffusion model.\nOnce Midjourney analyzes your input, it finds the image closest to your description and then applies your preferred art style(s) before stitching them together.\nHow do you use Midjourney?\nUnlike other AI bots, Midjourney doesn't have a website or an app. Instead, you sign up for Midjourney's discord server.\nDiscord is a VoIP and Instant Messaging (IM) platform that lets users communicate and share images, text and videos. Discord is available on most operating systems, including Windows, Android, iOS, iPadOS, Linux and runs on web browsers.\nOnce you sign up for a Discord account, head to Midjourney's website and click on \"Join the Beta\".\nOnce you see the invite for the beta, click on \"Accept Invite\", and you should be able to get in.\nYou should now see a Midjourney icon on your Discord dashboard. Click on it and locate \"Newcomer Rooms\" in the channels. Click on it, and open any newcomer room.\nAs a free user, you will have a limit of 25 images. You are limited to public chat as a free user, meaning your request will take longer and be in the queue.\nTo begin using Midjourney, type /imagine in public chat, followed by your text prompt. Be as descriptive as possible, including preferred art styles, the mood, subjects etc.\nOnce your input is analyzed, Midjourney will present you with four images in a grid to choose. Pick the one you feel is closest to your description and select the U button below the grid to upscale it.\nAlternatively, you can press V to create more variations of your preferred picture. You can also re-run the program if the options aren't good enough. A free user will be limited to 25 images, so keep that in mind.\nInvite your friends and family to sign up for MC Tech 3, our daily newsletter that breaks down the biggest tech and startup stories of the day\nDAILY-EVENING\nSUBSCRIBE",

      "body": "Feb 2, 2023\n18 min ago\nANDERSON  There is something to be afraid of, but it's not Megan, a film about a frightening doll who becomes too attached to her human companion and the troubles that follow.\nSound scary? It wasn't, trust me.\nHow her relationship with the doll impacted Cady's (Violet McGraw) normal life was the real scary part.\nA kind and fairly quiet kid changes into someone willing to commit violence even against her kin to get what she wants.\nThat particular scene is Cady's 'bottom', the moment she realizes she has a problem.\nThis leads to probably the most tender moments in the movie. Gemma (Allison Williams), Cady's career-focused aunt and creator of Megan, realizes what Cady really needed  her.\nYou see, Cady's parents were killed in an accident and as a result,  Cady went to live with Gemma.\nMegan was created to keep Cady occupied and by default, at arm's length. All Cady wanted was to be treated as though she mattered.\nAs with most dystopia-esque films, the innovators are foolishly self-assured regarding their invention. Gemma was no exception.\nDespite warnings from a therapist and a wise colleague, Gemma ignores their advice, thus inventing a nightmare.\nWhile an important commentary about the need for human contact and the pitfalls with AI, it has some problems, starting with the writing.\nIt seemed as though Akela Cooper and James Wan just kind of threw it together without really thinking what genre of film they wanted to make or what the focus would be.\nThe kills seemed to be thrown in without a lot of thought as did Gemma's character arc.\nPersonally, I would have focused on the relationship between Gemma and Cady more than the doll. It would not have been a Chucky-esque horror film.\nAs far as the acting was concerned, Violet McGraw's ability to stir emotion was mesmerizing and at times, unnerving. I am excited to see how her career pans out.\nOverall, I thought the message was timely, but as a film, it fell flat. Out of 10, I would give it a three.\nFollow Caleb Amick on Twitter @AmickCaleb.

      "body": "dashveen@hybrid.co\nAll stories\nIBM and NASA are collaborating to study climate change using AI. Here are their plans.(Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP)\nA new study published on Monday by Stanford University and Colorado State University indicated that the world is on the brink of breaching a critical climate threshold. Researchers used AI to predict warming timelines and found that 1.5C of warming over industrial levels will probably be crossed in the next decade. Since AI has been a game-changing critical enabler to speed up our race against climate change, IBM and NASA have decided to collaborate on the same work  the study\ndiscovery and analysis of these data\nto quickly advance the scientific understanding of the Earth, and our response to climate-related issues. On top of that, IBM and NASA have plans to develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations. One of the projects will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASAs\nHarmonized Landsat Sentinel-2\n(HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites.\nBy analyzing petabytes of satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields, and wildlife habitats, this foundation model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planets environmental systems, IBM noted.\nAnother output from this collaboration is expected to be an easily searchable corpus of Earth science literature, the company added. Previously, IBM  has developed an NLP model trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organize the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge.\nContaining one of the largest AI workloads trained on\nPrimeQA\n, IBMs open-source, multilingual question-answering system. Beyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science could be infused into NASAs scientific data management and stewardship processes, IBM said.\nFor NASAs Marshall Space Flight Centers senior research scientist Rahul Ramachandran, the beauty of foundation models is that they can potentially be used for many downstream applications. Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams. You need teams across different organizations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets, he added.\nOther potential IBM-NASA joint projects in this agreement include constructing a foundation model for weather and climate prediction using\n, a dataset of atmospheric observations. IBM said the collaboration is part of NASAs Open-Source Science Initiative, a commitment to building an inclusive, transparent, and collaborative open science community over the next decade.\nAnalytics                                                                                                                                    Big Data",

No, it would be a computer program, nothing more. They would still be dead and gone.\nAnd heres another somewhat less ambitious approach to the same goal. Apparently a company is developing technology that would allow you to speak to loved ones after you shuffle off this mortal coil.\nFrom the Vice story\n:\nThe founder of a top metaverse company says that the fast-moving development of ChatGPT has pushed the timeline for one of his most ambitious and eccentric projects up by a matter of years. In an interview with Motherboard, Somnium Spaces Artur Sychov said a user has started to integrate OpenAIs chatbot into his metaverse, creating a virtual assistant that offers a faster pathway for the development of \nLive Forever\n mode, Sychovs project to allow people to store the way they talk, move, and sound until after they die, when they can come back from the dead as an online avatar to speak with their relatives.\nLeaving aside the narcissistic aspect of people continually having themselves recorded, they wouldnt be back. The deceased would still be dead. The AI reproduction would merely be a more sophisticated remembrance of the dearly departed than is available now, akin to a precious photo or video, nothing more.\nImmortality cannot be attained in the corporeal world.
