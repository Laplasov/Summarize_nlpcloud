The application's beta users are currently testing two more features that Systrom hopes to become the main pillars of the app.\nOne of them is a feed that will display posts made by users you have picked to follow along with their comments.

      "description": "ChatGPT is an open-source artificial intelligence bot that allows users to enter questions and provides answers. An educator explains implications.",
      "body": "ChatGPT\n.\nChatGPT is an open-source artificial intelligence bot that allows users to enter questions and provides answers that read as if a human created them. Those of us in education are concerned about students using these tools to plagiarize and cheat their way through classes. For example, students can easily feed a discussion prompt into ChatGPT and receive an acceptable answer in seconds, ask it to write poetry or even ask it to generate computer code.\nWhile these examples seem like smart shortcuts to avoid busy work, what we should be more concerned about is that this technology will allow students to stop making sense of the world in context with their personal, lived experiences.\nFor example, if I ask ChatGPT to describe my extroverted personality, it will tell me the types of social activities and events I might enjoy and general expectations regarding extroverts. But if I want to explore my extroverted personality in the context of my life, the relationships I have with others, my job requirements and my lived experiences, ChatGPTs answer would not capture the introspection and meaning required for developing a unique path forward to integrate my personality into my daily activities.\nThe sensemaking process is how we take in information, process it and use it to understand and generate a worldview. It works in four stages  we notice things in our environment through observation, we create interpretations of the event, we then author our own unique response based on our integration with previously held information and then enact what we feel are appropriate behaviors.\nThis is a key way that humans learn, even though we may not realize it. If we short-circuit this process by feeding the AI our questions, we shortchange the learning process. While we may notice something (or are forced to notice it because of an assignment), ChatGPT produces the answer. The AI does not compare alternative interpretations or explanations and certainly is not authoring a unique response grounded in the users experience. We are no longer authors of our own behavior, and instead, we are just reacting to an AIs response in the world around us.\nOne approach to address this challenge is for educators to stay one step ahead of AI, creating increasingly more challenging questions that require analysis, limiting the use of computers in class and during tests and incorporating software that can detect AI-generated answers. Most educators know this is like playing whack-a-mole, that the software (like Turnitin) that we use to detect cheating is already outmatched by the techniques students employ, that university IT departments are woefully underfunded and teachers overextended with larger and larger class sizes.\nEducators must find a middle ground, incorporating the technology while underscoring the value and process of knowledge acquisition. This approach embodies the fundamental belief regarding education espoused by Plato, that education is not just memorizing dates and facts, but is a lifelong practice of learning and a requirement for social justice.\nBut professors have another option. Instead of embarking on a futile fight to ban technologies like ChatGPT, they can help their students better understand why its so important to learn how to make sense of what they are learning. They can do this by integrating the technology into their teaching.\nToo many individuals see learning as another task they must do and a degree just something they must attain, forgetting that learning creates connections between our neurons and allows us to interpret what we observe in multiple ways, driving new connections and authoring innovation for the world around us. If learners are no longer interested in seeking knowledge, and merely employ ChatGPT to provide answers, we will literally stop making sense. A better way forward is to use the technology to galvanize and personalize the sensemaking process.\nGretchen Vogelgesang Lester, Ph.D., is an associate professor at San Jose State University and public voices fellow of",

What we know about the future of AI in education.\nHow are real estate agents using ChatGPT?\nTony Angelos, a Chicago-based broker, said he started using ChatGPT soon after OpenAI launched the program in November 2022.\nIts a total game changer, he said. For most real estate agents, \"marketing and prospecting is really most of the jobs core functions. And this is a very cost-effective way to completely eliminate one of those things.\"\nAngelos uses the program regularly to come up with scripts for social media videos and listing descriptions.\nEarlier this week, he had the AI program write a script about things to do in Chicago in February. He said what would have taken him 20 minutes to write took ChatGPT five seconds.\nI said make it a little funnier, and it made it funnier for me, he said. It's not perfect by any means. But it is an amazing starting point.\nPaige Hewitt, a realtor based in Indianapolis, has used ChatGPT to help write listing descriptions and marketing newsletters. She said the programs capabilities far exceeded her expectations, and she's excited that the time it saves her means she can spend more time with clients.\nIt's going to make my job easier, which is going to make me stronger at my job, she said.\nWhile the technology is a growing trend in the industry, the National Association of Realtors' director of emerging technology, David Conroy, says business usage among realtors has so far been limited.\nRelief for homebuyers in 2023:\nMortgage rate buydowns are on the rise as homebuyers cope with high interest rates\nHow much does ChatGPT cost?\nWhile ChatGPT is free for now, OpenAI's official Discord server in January said the company was \"starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT\" to \"continue improving and maintaining the service.\"\nReal estate agents told USA TODAY they believe the tool would be well worth the money.\nWe've been playing around with different AI platforms for years now and none of them have been very good, Puma said. With ChatGPT, we can now build really unique things on top of this that make the agents' life even easier.\"\nSchools nationwide are banning ChatGPT:\nWhat are ChatGPT's limits?\nChatGPT has proven to be useful, but its not perfect.\nIts popularity means it regularly reaches full capacity, forcing users to wait their turn to use the program. And because it was trained with writing from the internet up to 2021, some of its information is outdated.\nConroy from NAR warned that anything generated with AI should be thoroughly reviewed by licensed professionals. That includes listing descriptions; he notes that NAR's code of ethics prohibits the exaggeration or misrepresentation of pertinent facts.\n\"There could be scenarios where listing descriptions created by using AI could unintentionally include language or descriptions that are not intended or even violate fair housing laws,\" Conroy said in an emailed statement. \"It is important to remember that real estate professionals have a responsibility to their clients to be honest and truthful.\"\nYou can follow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter\nand subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday.\nFeatured Weekly Ad",

Many other areas will incorporate artificial intelligence sooner or later and all of them will be affected in one way or another.&nbsp;Drones, medical devices and even \"softer\" areas such as hiring, character analysis, social networks and education will be at the center of the revolution. Artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT are changing the world (Illustrative). (credit: PIXABAY)Our ability as human beings to develop and the human brain, in particular, is built on the experience and learning we experience over the years. Impressions, opinions, readings and conversations with others allow us to accumulate experiences, store data, analyze it, form opinions and derive insights. AI is built on a similar principle, which is based on the technology of training and learning data and examples from the past.A significant part of the products of AI is based on information produced by humans, which contains personal insights and conclusions and not necessarily verified facts. That is, the algorithm model of intelligence basically contains biases and human opinions.&nbsp;Imagine, for example, a police tool for identifying suspects - a tool that can certainly streamline police work. If the system is entered on the basis of the data of previous arrests, it can be assumed that a bias based on the past, \"stigma\", will be created against specific people, who are not necessarily the immediate suspects.What is even more surprising is that even facts can generate a kind of bias in models or fake news because they study an existing situation and this perpetuates and preserve it. For example, the marvelous tool ChatGPT has been trained on information that is valid until 2021, so if you ask it who the current US President is, it will not be able to answer you. As far as it is concerned, the president of the United States is still Donald Trump.Discrimination on the basis of artificial groundsA famous example of the bias of AI is a model developed by Amazon, one of the largest technology companies in the world with more than 1.6 million employees and a growth rate of tens of percent per year.&nbsp;In 2018, the company received a huge amount of resumes, which required a lot of effort and resources for the screening and recruitment process. Amazon decided to rely on the AI capabilities it developed and the data that exists in the organization and to perform initial screening based on machine learning.Surprisingly, AI research scientists at Amazon have exposed biases against women in the recruitment process. As with other leading tech companies in the US, which have not yet narrowed the gender gap in hiring (especially in tech staff), the majority of Amazon employees are men.The algorithm that was developed and was based on facts and real data, continued the trend and maintained the existing attitude in society, which did not really allow the same opportunity for women and men. Moreover, the number of women in the tech giant is so small compared to the men that even if the model were to statistically disqualify all women candidates, it would still have very high success rates. The company took a while to come up with the problem and when it identified it, it immediately stopped using the recruitment system.Not in our schools?Earlier this month, it was reported that public schools in New York City would ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT, the same powerful chatbot tool recently launched by research firm OpenAI, on their computers.The concern is that the platform, which can create connections according to users' instructions, will help students with their tasks and may spread misinformation and give it some kind of training.\"Although the tool can provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for academic success and life in general,\" Jenna Lyle, a spokesperson for the New York Department of Education said.It is important that schoolchildren become familiar with ChatGPT, learn the limitations of technology, develop critical thinking towards the products, know how to ask the right questions and cross-reference information from other sources.Will AI be capable of overpowering humanity? (credit: Wikimedia Commons)In recent years, we have witnessed a phenomenon in which people do not check the reliability of information and tend to take it for granted. Needless to say, even if schools restrict access to the platform, students will find their way to it. Instead of trying to limit it, you can ask students to add due diligence that this essay or paragraph was written with the help of AI.The fear of new technologies, which are initially perceived as threatening, is not something new and is perfectly understandable.At the same time, instead of completely eliminating the use of the same technologies, it is necessary to find ways to develop them correctly, as well as to be aware of their capacity for biases and limitations.History has shown that progress cannot be stopped and the right way is to know how to live with it alongside the pros and cons. Looking ahead in another decade, we can say that AI will not replace people, the people who use AI will replace those who do not.Sign up for the Business & Innovation Newsletter >>",

The heir to the French throne is captivated by her, and although she rejects him, her jealous husband tries to poison her. Ultimately, Laura's righteousness is proven and happiness is restored.\nGredos publishing house will release the book in Spanish in the coming months.",

      "body": "0\ncomments\nOpenAI has recently released a classifier that aims to determine whether a piece of text was authored by artificial intelligence (AI) platforms like its own ChatGPT tool.\nThe company released the tool after various educational institutions and school districts banned ChatGPT because some students are relying on it completely to write their papers and pass it off as their own, which of course is cheating. Currently, ChatGPT is banned in New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Baltimore public school districts. Some universities in France and India have also restricted access to the tool. Finally, some states in Australia have blocked students from accessing ChatGPT on school internet networks.\nOpenAI describes its text classifier as \"a fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources, such as ChatGPT.\" Despite this claim, however, the company itself admits that the tool is unreliable. In their own evaluation of English texts, the classifier correctly identified only 26% of AI-written text as likely written by AI, and deemed 9% of human-written text as AI-authored. What's more, OpenAI says that the classifier might be unreliable on texts that are below 1,000 characters and written in other languages aside from English.\nIn our own testing, OpenAI's classifier correctly deemed most of the articles published on Neowin as \"very unlikely\" to be generated by AI. However, the tool was indecisive with our recent\noverage\n, saying that it is \"unclear if it is AI-generated.\" When tested with content generated via ChatGPT, the classifier seems to be a bit doubtful, saying that the content is \"possibly AI-generated.\"\nThis is probably why OpenAI says that the results generated by the classifier should not be the \"sole piece of evidence\" when determining if a piece of content was written by AI. Thankfully, there are other tools you can use. For instance, Stanford researchers recently introduced DetectGPT, a tool to help educators detect AI-generated papers. Also, a computer science student at Princeton developed a similar tool that can \"quickly and efficiently\" determine whether an essay is a created by ChatGPT.\nTags",

Trained on an immense amount of data from the internet and public domain, it's based on the powerful GPT-3.5 language model. This advanced AI can perform a wide range of tasks, such as summarizing text, writing code, creating fiction, and generating responses to prompts.",
      "body": "WATCH VIDEO: What Is ChatGPT and Why Has Google Declared It a Code Red\nIts remarkable capabilities have captured the worlds attention, with people amazed at how human-like its language generation is. In fact, ChatGPT has even passed a US law school test and an MBA exam, demonstrating its high level of intelligence.\nSo how did OpenAI  a relatively new company, achieve such rapid success? It all started with its billionaire founders, including Elon Musk, who co-founded the company in 2015 before eventually stepping down from the board but remaining a donor.\nHowever, the real change came in 2019 when Microsoft, a major competitor to Google and Apple, purchased a $1 billion stake in the company, with additional investments of $3 billion, as reported by the NY Times. Recently, Microsoft confirmed that it has invested a staggering $10 billion in OpenAI, indicating a serious commitment to the technology and a desire to compete with the likes of Google, Apple, and Amazon.\nThe fruits of this collaboration are already evident. Microsoft is integrating OpenAIs ChatGPT AI into its cloud technology Azure, providing even more advanced capabilities to users.\nSo, is ChatGPT better than what Google and Meta have to offer and do they have a competing product in development?\nWhile it is not entirely accurate to say that ChatGPT is more advanced than Google, it does present data in a more user-friendly way, but its knowledge base is limited to 2021. Its important to note that Google primarily serves as a search engine, while ChatGPT is a trained language model.\nGoogle itself has a language model called LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, which could rival ChatGPT. In fact, the technology behind ChatGPT was created by Google researchers. However, Google has been cautious about widely distributing its language technologies due to the potential for generating harmful, inaccurate, and biased information. Currently, LaMDA is only available to a limited number of individuals through an experimental app called AI Test Kitchen.\nOther tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta, have also faced similar issues with their chatbots in the past. Microsoft released a chatbot called Tay in 2015 that was quickly removed from the internet due to its racist and xenophobic language, while Meta also took down a chatbot for similar reasons.\nBut heres what makes things interesting: Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, has stated that the company plans to integrate ChatGPT into Bing, Microsofts search engine. With the potential for GPT 3.5 or 4.0, combined with Bing, the overall experience could be comparable or even better than Google, which is why Google could have declared it a Code Red.\nRead all the Latest Tech News here\nAbout the Author",

The visually stunning game was shown taking advantage of cutting-edge DLSS 3 rendering alongside the reveal of an RT Overdrive mode that will push the already intensive real-time ray-tracing in the game even further.\nExclusive to GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs (RTX 4090, RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti), DLSS 3 is a combination of DLSS Super Resolution, NVIDIA Reflex, and Frame Generation. The latter needs the new GeForce GPUs because it is an intensive AI process involving specific hardware that can generate new frames to boost performance. As per the video posted by NVIDIA above, we're talking about the sort of leap that has made DLSS 3 one of the most talked about bits of PC gaming tech in the past year.\n\"Playing Cyberpunk 2077 with the AI-powered performance of NVIDIA DLSS 3 is the best way to access the stunning visuals the game has to offer - this technology helps us take a new step toward combining unconstrained visual fidelity with exceptional performance.\"\nJakub Knapik, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED.\nThere have been some criticisms around DLSS 3's funky way of dealing with UI elements and text. On that front, NVIDIA notes that the Cyberpunk 2077 implementation features notable improvements in these areas, which might be one of the reasons its release was delayed. Latency, another critical area, is improved over just using DLSS 2 - with the RTX 4090 and DLSS 3 resulting in 41ms versus the RTX 3090 Ti's and DLSS 2's 78ms. It also delivers over double the performance using less power.\nAs per NVIDIA's 1440p and 4K benchmarks, DLSS 3 sounds incredible when you see the massive leap in performance.\n3\nVIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES\n3\nHaving checked out the update, I can confirm that the results are mind-blowing with no perceivable loss in visual quality. Using a GeForce RTX 4080 running the benchmark in 4K with RT Ultra settings and no DLSS, the result was an average fps of 30. With DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, this increased to 80fps.\nWith DLSS 3 finally in Cyberpunk 2077, now we wait for the RT Overdrive update.\nCyberpunk 2077: The Complete Official Guide-Collector's Edition\nToday\n* Prices last scanned on 1/31/2023 at 9:45 pm CST - prices may not be accurate, click links above for the latest price.

      "description": "Cheaters beware: ChatGPT maker releases AI detection tool",
      "body": "Share on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP)  The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.\nThe new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPTs ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.\nOpenAI cautions that its\n like others already available  is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes, said Jan Leike, head of OpenAIs alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.\nBecause of that, it shouldnt be solely relied upon when making decisions, Leike said.\nTeenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAIs website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.\nBy the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.\nThe Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.\nWe cant afford to ignore it, Robinson said.\nThe district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a personal tutor or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.\nSchool districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.\nThe initial reaction was OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT, said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that this is the future and blocking it is not the solution, he said.\nI think we would be nave if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power, said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the companys detection service is in place.\nOpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.\nThe longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text -- a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man --- and the tool will label it as either very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated.\nBut much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, its not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.\nWe dont fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally, Leike said. Theres really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.\nHigher education institutions around the world also have begun debating responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of Frances most prestigious universities, prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using ChatGPT and other AI tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.\nIn response to the backlash, OpenAI said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators.\nLike many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that its inappropriate for use in their classrooms, said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. We dont really push them one way or another. We just want to give them the information that they need to be able to make the right decisions for them.\nIts an unusually public role for the research-oriented San Francisco startup, now backed by billions of dollars in investment from its partner Microsoft and facing growing interest from the public and governments.\nFrances digital economy minister Jean-Nol Barrot recently met in California with OpenAI executives, including CEO Sam Altman, and a week later told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that he was optimistic about the technology. But the government minister  a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the French business school HEC in Paris  said there are also difficult ethical questions that will need to be addressed.\nSo if youre in the law faculty, there is room for concern because obviously ChatGPT, among other tools, will be able to deliver exams that are relatively impressive, he said. If you are in the economics faculty, then youre fine because ChatGPT will have a hard time finding or delivering something that is expected when you are in a graduate-level economics faculty.\nHe said it will be increasingly important for users to understand the basics of how these systems work so they know what biases might exist.\n---\nDownload the FOX10 Weather App. Get life-saving severe weather warnings and alerts for your location no matter where you are.

      "body": "ChatGPT is not an author: Science journals ban listing AI as co-author on papers\nFebruary 1, 2023\nIt took Spotify reach a million user base about five months, Instagram reached a million users in two months, ChatGPT barely took five days to get a million subscribers. The AI tool is already revolutionising the world with its open source algorithm and wider than imagined use.\nBut not everyone is impressed by the AI tool.\nChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that has been developed by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research company OpenAI. The chatbot understands natural language and responds in a human-like manner. It is based on GPT-3.5, which is a language model. The chatbot was unveiled as a prototype on November 30, 2022.\nThe academic community has strongly come out against the AI tool, with several science journals banning the tool from being listed as a co-author on scientific papers and publications. Science journal publishers have restricted the use of the AI-driven advanced chatbot from being used in research papers.\nThe leading US journal Science has updated its editorial policy and said, For the Science journals, the word original is enough to signal that text written by ChatGPT is not acceptable: It is, after all, plagiarized from ChatGPT.\nWe are now updating our license and Editorial Policies to specify that text generated by ChatGPT (or any other AI tools) cannot be used in the work, nor can figures, images, or graphics be the products of such tools. And an AI program cannot be an author. A violation of these policies will constitute scientific misconduct no different from altered images or plagiarism of existing works, Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the journal Science, wrote in an editorial.\nThe Science journal Nature has also said that there is a need for ground rules following the outburst of ChatGPT-like AI tools on the scene. The journal in an editorial said that it is high time researchers and publishers laid down ground rules about using Large Language Models (LLM) ethically.\nFirst, no LLM tool will be accepted as a credited author on a research paper. That is because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility. Second, researchers using LLM tools should document this use in the methods or acknowledgments sections. If a paper does not include these sections, the introduction or another appropriate section can be used to document the use of the LLM, Nature said in its updated editorial policy.",

      "body": "Jammu\nTawi, January 31: Chief Secretary, Dr Arun Kumar Mehta today remarked that after successfully digitizing all the services, focus should be laid on timely delivery of services and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in managing the affairs of government departments.\nMehta was speaking in the 14th Board of Governors (BoG) meeting of the Jammu & Kashmir e-Governance Agency (JaKeGA) attended by other members including Principal Secretary, Industries and Commerce; Commissioner Secretary, IT; Secretary, PD&MD; Secretary, GAD; DG, Codes; SIO, NIC besides other concerned officers.\nThe Chief Secretary stressed on moving towards use of AI/ML and IoT based technologies for better coordination and monitoring purposes. He maintained that technology is panacea for many of the problems. It is also the most effective tool for ensuring  transparency. He impressed upon the officers and scientists from IT and NIC respectively to work towards use of modern technologies towards obtaining desired results especially for the purposes of work estimation and their  identification.\nThe Chief Secretary also emphasized upon end to end use of digital platforms like e-office by all the government employees especially ground workers like Patwaris, JEs etc. He declared that the actual purpose of digitization would be served when it enhances ease of living. He asked for making the work of every office be it Police Stations, Tehsil Offices, Hospitals, Engineering Departments, ULBs, Block Offices fully online for efficient delivery and effective monitoring.\nThe Commissioner Secretary, IT, PrernaPuri gave a detailed presentation on the decisions taken during the 13th BoG meeting. She also detailed out the agenda for the meeting with a proposal for revamping the agency on more professional lines that would make the working of the J&K e-Governance agency more outcome oriented as per the requirements of present times.\nIt was revealed that in the previous meeting the decisions like establishment of 1012 ICT labs in schools, digitisation of office records, rolling out of National Generic Document Registration System, procurement of infrastructure for Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme and upgradation of State Data Centre was achieved as per the respective proposals.\nLater on the Chief Secretary also launched the State Wide Area Network (SWAN) coverage for 168 blocks of the UT. He advised  giving access to the 10 most vital offices at district level and 5 such offices at block levels for their easy access to safer network.\nSHARE",

      "description": "The makers of ChatGPT have introduced a new tool that may help educators distinguish between a text written by AI and a text written by humans.",
      "body": "OpenAI, the San Francisco-based research firm behind ChatGPT, says it has released a new tool to help distinguish between AI-written text and human-written text. The firm announced the release of an initial version of the release on Tuesday, saying it aims to collect feedback and share improved methods in the future.  The makers of ChatGPT cautioned that it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written texts. However, the firm believes that good classifiers can help flag automated misinformation campaigns, positioning an AI chatbot as a human, and using AI tools for academic dishonesty.  The \"Al Text Classifiers\" launch comes after week of discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT's ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning. POTENTIAL GOOGLE KILLER COULD CHANGE US WORKFORCE AS WE KNOW IT Teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAI's website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators. By the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.  The longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text  a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\"  and the tool will label it as either \"very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely\" AI-generated.

Bear in mind that limiting temperature increases to 1.5 C was the ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nThe drastic measures originally proposed to cut emissions and stay under 1.5 C of warming will now most likely be required to avoid a 2 C increase, according to the authors of the new study. The 2 C is pegged as when global warming consequences get significantly Worse for life on the planet.\nBut we are already seeing a litany of climate impacts in the form of heatwaves, bushfires, floods, and storms with just 1.1 C of global heating. So, limiting temperature increases as much as possible matters, because every fraction of a degree counts.\nTheres more: The AI model shows that even if greenhouse gas emissions rapidly decline to hit net zero by 2076, theres a 1 in 2 chance of hitting 2 C of warming by 2054, and a 2 in 3 chance of hitting it between 2044 and 2065.\nUsing an entirely new approach that relies on the current state of the climate system to make predictions about the future, we confirm that the world is on the cusp of crossing the 1.5 C threshold, says climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh from Stanford University in California.\nOur AI model is quite convinced that there has already been enough warming that 2 C is likely to be exceeded if reaching net-zero emissions takes another half century.\nHow the AI Prediction breaks down. (Dana Granoski/Diffenbaugh & Barnes, PNAS2023)\nTo reach these estimates, rather than using predictive climate models and global carbon budgets to calculate future warming, the researchers fed an AI known as a neural network a database of temperature changes that have already happened.\nThese neural networks use a vast number of weighted nodes to spot patterns in existing data, patterns which can then be extrapolated out into the future. In particular, the AI looked at recent temperature rises in specific locations compared with reference data from between 1951 and 1980.\nTo first test the accuracy of the future estimates, the AI was asked to predict the current rise of 1.1 C above pre-industrial levels. Sure enough, it returned the correct year of 2022, with a most likely range of 2017 to 2027.\nThis was really the acid test to see if the AI could predict the timing [of warming] that we know has occurred, says Diffenbaugh. We were pretty skeptical that this method would work until we saw that result.\nThe fact that the AI has such high accuracy increases my confidence in its predictions of future warming.\nThe AIs Prediction that the world will be a degree and a half hotter by the early 2030s matches conclusions in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, which state, the central estimate of crossing the 1.5 C threshold lies in the early 2030s, adding further confidence in the AIs accuracy.\nTheres still some uncertainty about when we might reach that 2 C rise, which is understandable when youre trying to simulate an entire planet many years into the future. What we do know is that increased temperatures will trigger additional tipping points, creating a feedback loop of even more warming.\nThats why the 2 C level is considered so important by scientists. Its effects will be felt in crop failures, sea level rises, the collapse of ecosystems on land and in the seas, economic downturns and severe impacts on human health.\nZero-emission goals covering carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping gases would have to be hit by the middle of this century, the team suggests, to avoid going over 2 C of warming. Right now, most countries are aiming at somewhere between 2050 and 2070 to bring their emission levels down to zero.\nThose net-zero pledges are often framed around achieving the Paris Agreement 1.5 C goal, says Diffenbaugh.\nOur results suggest that those ambitious pledges might be needed to avoid 2 C [warming].\nThe research has been published in PNAS.\nRelated",

      "description": "The launch of ChatGPT has made experts ponder over the usage of AI in therapy",
      "body": "Ananya Sethia, 33, a Bengaluru-based software programmer confesses that she has been hooked to ChatGPT ever since it launched in early December. Honestly, it doesnt feel like youre talking to a bot. Its a near-human experience, she says. Sethia who is an avid user of the bot says that she has been asking it questions about how to navigate toxic relationships, flirting, family issues, and other intimate, private thoughts too. She articulates, I dont feel judged, it is a private conversation and the responses I receive are pushing me to think and behave positively. I feel AI has a lot of usage in therapeutic interventions.Another programmer based in Bengaluru, Aseem Upadhye, 29, feels the same way. Ive been struggling to find a decent therapist and for someone like me, with financial constraints, ChatGPT is a great tool. Upadhye has been chatting with the AI since it launched and finds comfort in the responses he gets. The functionality has improved greatly and now, it may seem as good as speaking with a therapist with decades of experience.While programmers and even laymen might find ChatGPT and similar AI tools useful in dire times and situations, mental health practitioners continue to debate whether or not ChatGPT can be effective for therapeutic interventions.Also read: Feeling blue? It could be because of a thyroid disorderDisrupting the mental health domainToday, people can access support from others on community platforms, engage with self-care tools, and consume clinically-backed content from several credible websites. In some pockets of the world, researchers are also exploring the use of VR, or virtual reality therapy, for the treatment of different mental health conditions.Most mental health practitioners agree that artificial intelligence is evolving and disrupting every industry, including the mental health space. It is difficult to predict how its going to influence our daily lives from now onwards, remarks Ajith Abraham, Dean, Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences, FLAMES University, Pune. Neurological analytics bring tremendous opportunities and challenges because of the availability of huge amounts of data for analysis. Several machine learning methods were found successful in diagnosing mental health conditions, he observes. While computer vision helps in understanding non-verbal cues, such as facial expression, gestures, pose, eye gaze etc., natural language processing has been used for simulating human conversations via computer programs for self-assessments and therapy sessions.Mahima Sahi, the chief psychologist at heyy, a mental health app, elaborates that there has been a huge rise in the usage of machine learning algorithms to train AIs for extended relief. Some popular apps like Wysa have made use of an AI to solve user concerns, with their relief-bot.A cautionary tale?Practitioners such as Sahi, though, are wary about AI being perceived as a replacement for traditional therapy. Having used ChatGPT, she says you get no visibility to the sources it picked its answers from, while you sure get an answer! While this can be fixed by the creators, as a psychologist, Sahi believes that an AI like this can narrow the processing of the brain with time and make it habitual towards getting well-cut information to any problem statement, thus, never enabling the development of one's own complex cognitive or executive functioning.Initial concerns similar to these are already traceable from Academician reports of students who are using the AI to complete their assignments, she states.At the same time, people fear therapy so much that they are trying to find replacements for it. As Dr Rashi Agarwal a psychiatrist based in Meerut says, Its good to take charge of your health and well-being, but some things need to be done by experts, people who have been trained specifically to handle the situations. We have to use technology for our benefit and not the other way round.Dr Meghana Dikshit, an author, and performance coach who has used the chatbot feels that it is all about perspective since it depends on the question that the user asks. In my experience, when it comes to mental health, a lot of times what people say and what they actually mean are very different. They may come up with a certain challenge but beneath it, they have a completely different issue. AI is not always right, its full of biases. So, to get the best output we need a human in the loop.In many ways, ChatGPT operates like a search engine (for content) or a chatbot (for coping tools). And while having access to content and coping tools is important for a person with mental health difficulties, for treatment of clinical conditions, its best to rely on the advice of a trained professional. Dr Amit Malik, the founder & CEO of Amaha Health says, I dont see the platform replacing therapy/treatments delivered by a human anytime soon, especially given the diversity of presentations in mental health - when even within the same diagnosis, different individuals will have different nuances - that require a personalised therapeutic approach.Additionally, some people with clinical challenges will require medication support, for which they must consult a trained psychiatrist.How to use AI for emotional wellbeingEmotional and mental health challenges are complex. There are several factors that need to be considered in order to understand, evaluate, and treat such challenges. These include, but are not limited to a persons lifestyle, family history, past medical and psychological history, current environment and personality traits, among others.Sahi believes that AI, if trained effectively, keeping the personalisation, accuracy and for need understanding of the user's concerns in mind, can definitely aid the mental health space and help create scalable mental health solutions in times to come. MHPs and Institutes should, thus, invest some time and energy in doing credible research for finding effective means for personalisation and effective tracking of outcomes, of something as intangible as mental health, tangibly yet effectively! she says.It can potentially aid clinicians in making a faster, more accurate diagnosis and analysing client information/data to help clinicians predict relapses and other high-risk situations. Dr Dikshit adds that AI can pre-empt a persons behaviour using algorithms and in turn, can suggest a course correction in advanceAlso read: Can scream therapy improve your mental health?During the last few years, several factors including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have aggravated mental health issues. The numbers are steadily rising, and there is a shortage of mental healthcare professionals. This is where AI can come into play. Accessibility and affordability while being easy to open up and maintaining strict privacy are some of the pros, says Dr Abraham, adding that AI can help clinicians evolve treatment plans. Having said that, all experts are on board with Dr Mal",

They include a new chatbot and a potential way to integrate it into a search engine.\nThe Alphabet company is working on a project under its cloud unit called Atlas, which is a code red effort to respond to ChatGPT, the large-language chatbot that took the public by storm when it went public late last year.\nGoogle is also testing a chatbot called Apprentice Bard, where employees can ask questions and receive detailed answers similar to ChatGPT. Another product unit has been testing a new search desktop design that could be used in a question-and-answer form.\nLeaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks. CNBC viewed internal documents and spoke with sources about the efforts currently underway.\nThe product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the companys competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT, which was launched by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based startup thats backed by Microsoft.\nGoogles AI chief Jeff Dean told employees at the time that the company has much more reputational risk in providing wrong information and thus is moving more conservatively than a small startup. However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public some time this year. Googles prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI.\nApprentice Bard\nOne of the test products is a chatbot called Apprentice Bard, which uses Googles conversation technology LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications.\nAs a result of ChatGPT, the LaMDA team has been asked to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT, read one internal memo viewed by CNBC. In the short term, it takes precedence over other projects, the email continued, warning that some employees stop attending certain unrelated meetings.",

      "body": "Very large text size\nAdvertisement\nOpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, has released an imperfect software tool to identify text generated by artificial intelligence as worries grow in academic and teaching circles that its tools could enable widespread cheating.\nIt allows the start-up to sell to both sides of a burgeoning arms race that could extend beyond the classroom into people trying to spread, and detect, things such as online misinformation campaigns fuelled by AI-generated content.\nChat GPT is a language-processing AI model that is capable of generating human-like text, such as essays.\nCredit:\niStock\nChatGPT is a free online tool that generates text in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, which has gained wide popularity since its debut in November.\nThe AI classifier, a language model trained on the dataset of pairs of human-written and AI-written text on the same topic, aims to distinguish text that is written by AI. But OpenAI, which recently received a multibillion-dollar investment from Microsoft that industry publications said valued the firm at $US29 billion ($41 billion), has cautioned that its tool has a series of severe limitations.\nIn tests, OpenAI said its classifier correctly identified AI-written text 26 per cent of the time but described human-written passages as likely AI-written\" in 9 per cent of cases. It is also very unreliable on texts under 1000 characters and AI-written text can be edited to trick the classifier.\nLoading\nJan Leike, head of OpenAIs alignment team tasked to make its systems safer, warned that the system was not foolproof, telling AP the method for detecting AI-written text is imperfect and would sometimes be wrong.\nIt shouldnt be solely relied upon when making decisions, Leike said.\nAustralian universities have reportedly flagged a greater use of traditional assessment types such as pen and paper tests to prevent students having ChatGPT write their essays for them. Many Australian schools, including public schools in NSW, have banned ChatGPT. But some Australian academics have called for students to be taught to work with AI as a tool they will likely encounter in the workplace.\nAdvertisement\nThere are several tools available already to detect AI text, with varying degrees of accuracy. An AI research group called Hugging Face has created one tool and Edward Tian, a Princeton researcher, created another called GPTZeroX.\nAustralian universities have reportedly flagged a greater use of traditional assessment types such as pen and paper tests to prevent students having ChatGPT write their essays for them.\nCredit:\nistock\nOpenAI said in a blog post they were making their detection tool available in beta form to test whether it was useful.\nWe recognise that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognising the limits and impacts of AI-generated text classifiers in the classroom.\nOpenAI said it is engaging with educators to discuss ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations, and will continue to work on the detection of AI-generated text.\nLoading",

The survey highlights respondents views regarding digital transformation, wherein 87% of employees said the need for it is more important now than ever before.\nAccording to the results, 89% of participants with access to automation and AI-powered tools feel more fulfilled because they can spend time on work that truly matters.

As mentioned by Microsoft, the latter figure reflects the result of its 2022 Low-Code Trend Report, wherein 80% of respondents said low-code tools allowed them to be self-sufficient in addressing tasks instead of relying on developers.\nThe survey findings are clear: people want digital productivity tools that allow them to cut out the busywork so they can focus on the real tasks at hand, Microsoft concluded. They also want a say in how these tools are selected and implemented. Perhaps most of all, they want tools that are intuitive and easy to use, and that allow them to collaborate seamlessly and work efficientlywherever work happens to be.\nThe survey was released as the Redmond company continues to invest in AI technology.

      "body": "Robots\nImage: Paramount Pictures\nWith generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT and StableDiffusion being the talk of the town right now, it might feel like weve taken a giant leap closer to a sci-fi reality where AIs are physical entities all around us.\nIndeed, computer-based AI appears to be advancing at an unprecedented rate. But the rate of advancement in robotics  which we could think of as the potential physical embodiment of AI  is slow.\nCould it be that future AI systems will need robotic bodies to interact with the world? If so, will nightmarish ideas like the self-repairing, shape-shifting T-1000 robot from the Terminator 2 movie come to fruition? And could a robot be created that could live forever?\nEnergy for life\nBiological lifeforms like ourselves need energy to operate. We get ours via a combination of food, water, and oxygen. The majority of plants also need access to light to grow.\nBy the same token, an everlasting robot needs an ongoing energy supply. Currently, electrical power dominates energy supply in the world of robotics. Most robots are powered by the chemistry of batteries.\nAn alternative battery type has been proposed that uses nuclear waste and ultra-thin diamonds at its core. The inventors, a San Francisco startup called Nano Diamond Battery, claim a possible battery life of tens of thousands of years. Very small robots would be an ideal user of such batteries.\nBut a more likely long-term solution for powering robots may involve different chemistry  and even biology. In 2021, scientists from the Berkeley Lab and UMAss Amherst in the US demonstrated tiny nanobots could get their energy from chemicals in the liquid they swim in.\nThe researchers are now working out how to scale up this idea to larger robots that can work on solid surfaces.\nRepairing and copying oneself\nOf course, an undying robot might still need occasional repairs.\nIdeally, a robot would repair itself if possible. In 2019, a Japanese research group demonstrated a research robot called PR2 tightening its own screw using a screwdriver. This is like self-surgery! However, such a technique would only work if non-critical components needed repair.\nOther research groups are exploring how soft robots can self-heal when damaged. A group in Belgium showed how a robot they developed recovered after being stabbed six times in one of its legs. It stopped for a few minutes until its skin healed itself, and then walked off.\nAnother unusual concept for repair is to use other things a robot might find in the environment to replace its broken part.\nLast year, scientists reported how dead spiders can be used as robot grippers. This form of robotics is known as necrobotics. The idea is to use dead animals as ready-made mechanical devices and attach them to robots to become part of the robot.\nA robot colony?\nFrom all these recent developments, its quite clear that in principle, a single robot may be able to live forever. But there is a very long way to go.\nMost of the proposed solutions to the energy, repair and replication problems have only been demonstrated in the lab, in very controlled conditions and generally at tiny scales.\nThe ultimate solution may be one of large colonies or swarms of tiny robots who share a common brain, or mind. After all, this is exactly how many species of insects have evolved.\nThe concept of the mind of an ant colony has been pondered for decades. Research published in 2019 showed ant colonies themselves have a form of memory that is not contained within any of the ants.\nThis idea aligns very well with one day having massive clusters of robots that could use this trick to replace individual robots when needed, but keep the cluster alive indefinitely.\nUltimately, the scary robot scenarios outlined in countless science fiction books and movies are unlikely to suddenly develop without anyone noticing.\nEngineering ultra-reliable hardware is extremely difficult, especially with complex systems. There are currently no engineered products that can last forever, or even for hundreds of years. If we do ever invent an undying robot, well also have the chance to build in some safeguards.",

      "body": "VISIT WEBSITE\nArtificial Intelligence has seen many highs and lows over the decades, and it may now be about to take off again, thanks to the ChatGPT chatbot. The big question right now is how important ChatGPT is in the world of Artificial Intelligence, and does it represent a long-term trend or just a short-term opportunity?\nIts a truism that there are no guarantees  one thats even more for AI than other categories. We have seen many new ideas in technology simply fall flat after lots of hype. IBM Watson is a great recent example. Watson was an AI technology before we were even talking about AI. It took years to  develop, then appeared on the TV game show Jeopardy in 2011 and won. Not just the game but massive public attention. It hit the top of the charts around 2016 with the World of Watson event in Las Vegas. Then, seemingly overnight, it disappeared.\nWhere is IBM Watson today? Its still around, but\nthe AI growth wave moved to its next chapter.\nI believe ChatGPT is an important chapter in the AI story. But will it be long lived or will another company with another technology take over after a while, just as Google did to leading search browsers like Netscape and Yahoo?\nChatGPT was released last November by venture-backed OpenAI, and seems to have taken on a life of its own. Many new investors, most prominently Microsoft (\nChart\n\n), are jumping in to support its growth.\nChatGPT is short for Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer. It gives computers the ability to understand and respond to natural human language. It lets the computer talk with the user  not in short snippets but in something quite like conversation. And ChatGPT does it really well.\nAI using ChatGPT can be used to write research reports, articles and legal documents. It can write software code. But just because it can do these things, do we want it to do these things? There are real risks that face our society if we move ahead unchecked.\nChatGPT is young and new, but it has huge potential and thats why its getting so much investor attention. Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and experience the incredible growth wave this new technology represents.\nPoint one: I believe ChatGPT will lead to enormous and rapid growth for AI.\nPoint two: Its important to understand that this new technology is more like the Ford Model T than the computer on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. It will take a while to advance.\nPoint three: Will ChatGPT last, or will it just be one more step in a series of AI flashes in the pan?\nPoint four: Not everyone is happy about it. Not just ethicists, who worry about things like truth and accuracy. But competitors like Google, who are confronting a credible emerging threat to the search engine business.\nWhen new technology is being developed and improved, the ethical side is often ignored. In the case of AI, this would be a disaster. Elon Musk has been sounding warnings about AI for many years, as have others in the world of high-tech innovation.\nCount me among those who think we should take Musks warning to heart and move forward with our eyes wide open. To some degree, every advancement is a double-sided coin  improving our lives while also robbing us of other things we value.\nThis is just the beginning of the ChatGPT growth story in AI. It may be a great investment, but dont set it and forget it.",

      "body": "Jan 31, 2023 7:58 PM CST\n1 minute & 21 seconds read time\nRecently we reported that legal advice startup DoNotPay was planning to have two defendants dispute speeding tickets with AI \"robot lawyers\" feeding them what to say. DoNotPay even describes its app as \"the world's first robot lawyer,\" using AI text generators like ChatGPT and DaVinci.\n2\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\nThese traffic ticket disputes were just the first step in what the company hoped might lead to AI helping defendants take on corporations or even suing someone on their behalf. Well, as it turns out, these robot lawyers won't be pleading any cases anytime soon. The planned February 22 California traffic court hearing will now be robot lawyer free.\nLike most of us, it looks like the legal system is a little scared of a potential robot uprising - and enslavement of the human race via what we assume would be lawful means. DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder has told NPR, \"Multiple state bars have threatened us; one even said a referral to the district attorney's office and prosecution and prison time would be possible.\" If years of watching courtroom dramas on TV have taught us anything, once the DA gets involved - it's serious.\nThe use of AI in a courtroom potentially constitutes an \"unauthorized practice of law,\" which, in legalese, is a big no-no. And so the age-old threat of criminal charges has led to DoNotPay putting a stop to its robot lawyer dreams, primarily when the company is being investigated by multiple state bars.\nAs for DoNotPay, the company will pivot to assisting people with advice around mounting bills, credit reporting, and other bureaucratic things. \"I think calling the tool a 'robot lawyer' really riled a lot of lawyers up,\" Browder adds. \"But I think they're missing the forest for the trees.

Inspire them with a challenge to write draft legislation and work collaboratively? Give them only have five days to draft all the considerations and have the USA President Joe Biden support the campaign, with leading music industry players like: Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group as they dominate the music industry. Note: These three companies are the world's largest record companies, and they earned 32.1%, 20.6%, and 15.9%, respectively, of the revenue from global streaming and physical music sales in 2022 (source: Zippia). Perhaps my alma matter at Accenture can be inspired by this post to rally the industry or my dear special global AI friends at EY and Deloitte we really must get this right.\nWe dont need to research this problem - we need to simply advance thoughtful dialogue with new legislation. I am sure its looming somewhere in different states, but with announcements like ChatGPT3 and now with Googles MusicML, not yet released, due to copyright laws, surely Pandora is out of the box and leadership is imperative.\nThe reality is AI is not going to go away, so can we not identify the best solutions that we need to architect to get this industry moving in a direction where the North and South can actually align on new legislation.\nI need to do more research in this area and if you have any ideas, please send me a message on my Linkedin Channel @drcindygordon\nFollow me on",

      "body": "In early 2020, Dr Siya Seth was looking for a school with an International Baccalaureate curriculum and a professional cricket academy for her 16-year-old son. She had been researching for over four months without much success.The information she was seeking was scattered all over the internet and not organised. Besides, there was no platform to verify the details. She was also unable to compare the schools, so that she could narrow down the options best suited for her son.According to , a platform for school admissions and events, there are over 15 lakh schools in India and many more that are not officially registered. So, finding the right school is a big challenge. Inception of SkoodosDr Siya realised there was a huge information/dissemination gap and decided to do something about it. This led to the inception of Skoodos, which was officially launched in April 2020, under the parent company Spherion Solution Private Limited.Skoodos is a school search aggregator designed to allow parents and children to search for private schools based on preferred parameters and criteria and compare information about schools. The platform helps streamline the decision-making process for parents and also gives schools an equal and fair chance to showcase their strengths to their audience, says Dr Siya, Founder and MD, Skoodos.The information we provide through our platform is verified and serves the purpose of a school search engine platform, she says.You can find a restaurant, a house, and everything within a few clicks; why not schools?Skoodos seeks to help parents compare, shortlist, and select schools without even visiting them in person. School dhoondo is Dr Siyas motto, which explains the platforms namejuxtaposing the two words (school and dhoondo) and shortening them to form Skoodos.Our iconic element in the logo is a pair of binoculars, indicating that we can assist you in finding the best school for your childs needs, says Dr Siya, who has 20 years of work experience in the areas of skill development and womens empowerment.Prior to Skoodos, she had executed projects for the social sector with United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, and National Skill Development Corporation, in India and Kenya.Finding the right schoolSkoodos integrates information and user ratings of different schools and presents them in a microsite format. It also has a school-finding feature.The platform allows parents to compare schools based on over 40 criteria, such as school ranking, rating, year of establishment, education board, method of functioning (virtual or physical), category of school (special school/mainstream school), type of school (boarding, dayboarding, etc.), teachers and staff, subjects, facilities, infrastructure, extracurricular activities, fee structure, location and commute.Information on student-teacher ratio and average class strength is also provided on the platform.The microsite is easy to understand and provides comprehensive information, says Dr Siya. Users can view the information on the Skoodos website or mobile app. In case users need help, they can contact the backend team and a representative is assigned to their query.The platforms system is powered by artificial intelligence to provide the ideal match for users. We were highly determined that the method of choosing a school should be based on what a child needs and wants, says the Skoodos founder. Verification processTo register on the Skoodos platform, schools have to share detailed information about themselves. After this, the information is verified by an in-house team, comprising former teachers and tech-savvy people.The verification process requires the following details: school location, teachers background, results of the last three years, scores of the top six students in Grade 11 and 12 (for K-12 schools), years of establishment, achievements, etc.We also connect with the HODs of the schools to gather and verify the information. Once our verification team approves the information, our microsite process begins to ensure that the schools web portfolio follows our guidelines, elaborates Dr Siya.Business modelSkoodos has partnered with private schools from all boards and curricula (state, CBSE, ICSE, IB, CISCE, NIOS, CIE, matriculation, Montessori) and classes (preschool to Grade 12) Government-aided schools are not present on the platform at present, as that requires permission and authorisation from government bodies at various levels for the verification process.To date, Skoodos has partnered with about 14,000 schools in 742 cities across the country. It primarily operates in Maharashtra (1,672 schools), Tamil Nadu (627), Delhi (588), West Bengal (586), Karnataka (544), Telangana (249), and Gujarat (553).Our aim is to have every school in the nation enlisted in giving parents and students all the options they need to find the right one, asserts Dr Siya. Our focus is also on making sure the schools get the best visibility according to the facilities they offer.Skoodos charges schools a yearly subscription fee; it doesnt charge the end users. Subscription charges range from Rs 999 to Rs 50,000, depending on the kind of information schools want to display. The bootstrapped company was founded with an investment of Rs 4.8 crore from personal savings and a loan. In India, Skoodos competes with , an admissions consulting company, and , a school discovery platform. The startup has a team of 75 employees.Growth and futureSkoodos clocked a net revenue of Rs 11 crore and a net profit of Rs 29 lakh in FY21-22.It aims to register a net revenue of Rs 20 crore and a net profit of Rs 38 lakh in FY22-23. The platform has over two million users and it hopes to reach over 25 million by FY23. It has also set itself an ambitious target of onboarding 1.5 lakh schools in the next three months through various marketing, online and offline activities.The startup plans to open offices in Bengaluru and Kolkata soon and also expand outside Indiato UK, Canada and UAE in three years.

      "body": "The jobs under threat from AI, robots and big data\nIf ChatGPT doesn't ring any bells, here's your elevator pitch.\nThe bot said it \"can generate human-like text responses\" based on the input it receives when we asked it to describe itself.\n\"It's like having a virtual assistant that can answer questions, have conversations, and even write creative content with remarkable coherence,\" it continued.\n\"ChatGPT can process and understand language with great accuracy, making it a valuable tool for businesses, developers, and researchers.\"\nSo, there it is, straight from the AI's mouth.\nCreated by San Francisco-based AI research lab OpenAI, ChatGPT has read the entire collective works of humanity and leveraged state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.\nIt has learned patterns in language that it can recreate in seconds, generating original essays, stories and song lyrics in response to user prompts.\nChatGPT has even proven itself smart enough to pass prestigious US graduate-level exams  though not with particularly high marks.\nThe chatbot has been immediately banned in school classrooms across New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia.\nSome teachers fear cheating students will use it to write essays and complete questionnaires.\nOthers have called for assignments to revert to pen and paper.\nTesting ChatGPT with HSC English\nAs part of a series of stories investigating the impact of ChatGPT, 9news.com.au asked the bot to answer two questions from the 2022 HSC English exam.\nWe requested it write two 1100-word essays, which it declined, saying: \"That's a bit too much to type here, I can give you an idea of an essay and help you to elaborate it. Please, let me know what you would like to write about and I'll start.\"\nQ:\n\nHow has your study of King Henry IV, Part 1 altered and expanded your understanding of dishonour? In your response, make detailed reference to the prescribed text.\nA: The study of Shakespeare's play King Henry IV, Part 1 has greatly altered and expanded my understanding of the theme of dishonor. The play explores the idea that dishonor is not just a result of one's actions, but can also stem from the actions of those around us, as well as societal pressure and the need to conform.\nOne of the most prominent examples of dishonor in the play is the character of Prince Hal, who is portrayed as a wild and reckless youth. He is often seen carousing with criminals and drinking heavily, which is considered dishonorable behavior for a prince. However, as the play progresses, it becomes clear that Hal's actions are not entirely his own choice, but are also influenced by the pressure he feels to live up to his father's expectations and the societal pressure to be a certain way.\nAnother example of dishonor in the play is the character of Hotspur, who is portrayed as a brave and honorable warrior. However, his actions in the play lead to his downfall, as his impulsiveness and lack of foresight cause him to make poor decisions. Hotspur's behavior is also influenced by societal pressure, as he feels the need to prove himself to be a great warrior and live up to the expectations of others.\nFurthermore, the play also explores the idea that dishonor can be inherited, as seen in the character of Falstaff. He is a criminal and a liar, but he is also a close friend of Prince Hal and serves as a mentor to him. Hal is aware of Falstaff's dishonorable behavior, but he is unable to completely distance himself from him, as he feels a sense of loyalty towards him. This shows that dishonor can be inherited through our relationships and associations.\nIn conclusion, the study of King Henry IV, Part 1 has greatly expanded my understanding of the theme of dishonor. The play illustrates that dishonor is not just a result of one's own actions, but can also stem from the actions of those around us, as well as societal pressure and the need to conform. Additionally, the play also shows that dishonor can be inherited through our relationships and associations.\nREAD MORE:\nA: In Arthur Miller's\nThe Crucible\n, he uses the features of drama to represent the emotions arising from human experiences by creating complex and dynamic characters that struggle with fear, guilt, and betrayal. Through the use of dialogue, stage directions, and symbolism, Miller conveys the emotional turmoil of the characters as they are caught up in the witch trials in 17th-century Salem.\nFor example, John Proctor, the play's protagonist, grapples with guilt over his past adultery and is torn between confessing to save his life and preserving his reputation. Through his inner monologues and interactions with other characters, the audience can see the emotional turmoil he is experiencing. Similarly, Abigail Williams, the play's antagonist, is driven by fear and a desire for power, leading to her false accusations of witchcraft and ultimately causing the destruction of many innocent lives.\nFurthermore, Miller uses the setting of the play to reflect the emotional state of the characters and society. The rigid and oppressive society of Salem, in which individuals are quick to accuse and condemn each other, serves as a metaphor for the destructive effects of mass hysteria and the dangers of blindly following authority.\nIn conclusion, Arthur Miller uses the features of drama in The Crucible to represent the emotions arising from human experiences by creating complex and dynamic characters, through their interactions and inner monologues, who are caught up in an oppressive society and struggle with guilt, fear and betrayal.\nWhat a high school teacher thought\nA high school English teacher of students in years 7-12 reviewed both answers and graded ChatGPT's work as below average, scoring \"a 9/20 or lower\".\nHer notes on the bot's answers, which came back with American spelling despite British English being inputted into the system, reflected on the program's relative mediocrity.\nThe quality of the AI-generated essay content is somewhat sound, as it attempts to answer the given question, uses vocabulary quite well and effectively discusses some of the themes and plot information from the text.\nThe AI-generated essay, however, lacks textual evidence (quotations from the text) and textual analysis, which is a discriminating factor that teachers look for to assess understanding of a text.\nProviding textual evidence, analysis and synthesis between ideas is a very important part of a quality essay. Essays like the examples generated by AI would likely receive a \"developing\" outcome which equates to approximately a 9/20 or lower.\nHigh-performing English essays also generally require an analytical and authentic personal voice which AI cannot (yet) accomplish.\nREAD MORE:\nHe told 9news.com.au that banning the bot is a futile exercise.\nInstead, he said, its arrival invites us to rethink aspects of higher education.\n\"I wouldn't put it as a risk, I genuinely look at it as an opportunity,\" Popenici said.\n\"The reaction is, 'We are going to ban it'.

      "body": "The EEOC is focusing on the use of AI and other advanced technologies in recruitment.\nCarol Yepes/Getty Images\nAI may be the hiring tool of the future, but it could come with the old relics of discrimination.\nWith nearly every major employer in the United States now using artificial intelligence and automation in their hiring processes, the agency that enforces federal anti-discrimination laws is addressing some pressing issues:\nHow to prevent discrimination in hiring when discrimination is perpetuated by a machine? What type of railing could help?\nSome 83% of employers, including 99% of Fortune 500 companies, now use some form of automated tool as part of their hiring process, the chair of the Equal Opportunity Commission says. job, Charlotte Burrows, to a hearing on Tuesday titled Navigating Employment Discrimination in AI and Automated Systems: A New Civil Rights Frontier, part of a larger agency initiative examining how technology is used to recruit and hire people.\nEveryone needs to speak up in the debate about these technologies, she said.\nThe stakes are just too high to leave this topic to the experts alone, Burrows said.\nResume scanners, chatbots and video interviews can introduce bias\nLast year the The EEOC has published guidelines around the use of state-of-the-art recruiting tools, noting many of their shortcomings.\nResume scanners that prioritize keywords, virtual assistants or chatbots that sort applicants based on a set of predefined requirements, and programs that assess facial expressions and speech of a candidate during video interviews can perpetuate prejudice or create discrimination, the agency found.\nTake, for example, a video interview that analyzes a candidates speech patterns to determine their problem-solving abilities. A person with a speech impediment may get a low score and be automatically eliminated.\nOr, a chatbot programmed to reject applicants with gaps in their resume. The bot can automatically refuse a qualified candidate who had to stop working due to treatment for a disability or because he was absent for the birth of a child.\nOlder workers can be disadvantaged by AI-based tools in several ways, AARP senior counsel Heather Tinsley-Fix said in testimony at the hearing.\nCompanies that use algorithms to mine data from social media and professional digital profiles in the search for ideal candidates can ignore these that have a smaller digital footprint.\nPlus, theres machine learning, which could create a feedback loop that then harms future candidates, she said.\nIf an older candidate passes the CV screening process but is confused or interacts poorly with the chatbot, this data could teach the algorithm that candidates with similar profiles should be ranked lower, she said. declared.\nKnowing that you have been discriminated against can be difficult\nThe problem will be for the EEOC to eradicate discrimination  or prevent it from happening  when it can be buried deep within an algorithm. Those who have been denied employment may not relate to discrimination based on their age, race or disability.\nIn a lawsuit filed by the EEOC, a woman who applied for a job at a tutoring company only realized the company set an age limit after she applied for the same job and provided a date of birth different.\nThe EEOC is studying the most appropriate ways to handle the problem.\nTuesdays panelists, a group that included computer scientists, civil rights advocates and labor lawyers, agreed that audits are needed to ensure software used by companies avoids intentional or unintentional bias. But who would carry out these audits, the government, the companies themselves or a third party is a thornier question.\nEach option has risks, Burrows pointed out. A third party can be co-opted to treat customers with leniency, while a government-led audit could potentially stifle innovation.\nSetting standards for vendors and requiring companies to disclose the hiring tools they use were also discussed. It remains to be seen what this would look like in practice.\nIn previous remarks, Burrows noted the great potential that AI and algorithmic decision-making tools have to improve the lives of Americans, when used correctly.\nWe need to ensure that these new technologies dont become a high-tech route to discrimination, she said.\nSources\nThe mention sources can contact us to remove/changing this article\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

For Pakistan to progress, we need to change tracks quickly and try to tap into our real wealth  our children. Our key areas of focus should include information technology, next generation genomics, new materials, energy, regenerative medicine, minerals, and advanced agriculture.\nIn the information technology field, artificial intelligence (AI) is already having a fast growing impact in various sectors. It is finding use in medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, self-driving cars, etc, and replacing humans in repetitive tasks. It is estimated that the market size of AI will be about $16 trillion within five years. Other technologies in this field include blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G/6G networks.\n6G networks are expected to be much faster than 4G or 5G technologies and are likely to support applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), instant communications, pervasive artificial intelligence and the IoT.\nBlockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that is used to record transactions in a secure and transparent way. It has the potential to disrupt many industries, including supply chain management, finance and voting systems. Blockchain can also be used to create a decentralized digital currency that will ensure faster, cheaper and secure transactions. Another fast-emerging area in the information technology field is that of Internet of Things (IoT). This is a network of connected devices that can communicate the data with each other and share it. This technology has already begun to impact many industries such as transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare. IoT-enabled devices track vehicles in real time, monitor and control manufacturing processes and remotely monitor the health of patients.\nThe next generation of mobile networks will depend on 5G and 6G technologies. They provide much faster internet speeds with lower latency. This will have a huge impact on many industries including telecommunications, gaming, virtual reality, and remotely controlled surgery. 6G networks are expected to be even more diverse than their predecessors and are likely to support applications, such as virtual and augmented reality, instant communications, pervasive artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT).\nAnother fast-developing area is that of genomics. It is being used in medicine to develop precision medicine that considers the individuals genetic makeup. This has resulted in the development of targeted therapies for various diseases such as cancer. Thus, individual mutations in cancer patients can be identified and drugs then used to target those patient-specific mutations. The advent of gene editing tools is allowing disease-causing genes to be spiced out, and such techniques promise to cure genetic diseases.\nResearchers have also succeeded in using genomics in agriculture to identify those genes that are associated with desirable traits such as disease resistance or higher yields. This has led to the development of genetically modified crops that can better survive conditions of environmental stress and have resistance against pests. Genomics has also led to improved breeding of livestock, cows that produce more milk, grow faster and are resistant to diseases. Researchers have also identified genetic markers in humans that make them more prone to certain diseases. A dedicated research center named after my father  the Jamil ur Rahman Center for Genomics Research  is located in Karachi University and equipped with state-of-the-art facilities.\nAnother area is that of regenerative medicine. Anti-ageing compounds have been developed that can slow down the process of ageing, and this is a hot area of current research. Stem cell technologies are being developed to cure heart, lung, kidney, and eye diseases. An excellent laboratory focused on stem cell research has been established in the Dr Panjwani Centre for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, located within Pakistans premier research institute, the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS) at the University of Karachi.\nThe field of new materials is disrupting the manufacturing sector. It has seeped into various sectors such as those related to automobiles, space engineering, biomedical devices, pharmaceuticals, and a host of other fields. Lightweight composites and advanced steels are being extensively used in the automobiles industry as they result in improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. Metamaterials that have the strange ability of bending light are being used for stealth purposes to make objects such as tanks, airplanes and submarines invisible.\nCarbon fibres and ceramics are finding wide use in aircraft and space craft because of their increased strength and lightweight nature. In the construction industry, self-healing concrete and shape-memory alloys are being used in the building industry as they lead to improved strength and sustainability of structures. Nanotechnology has come to the fore in a big way and graphene as well as carbon nanotubes are being used in the electronics industry because of the resulting improvement in devices such as smartphones and laptops.\nAn excellent centre for nanotechnology research, The Latif Ebrahim Jamal Nanotechnology Center, has been established in the ICCBS, and it is carrying out ground-breaking research in nano pharmaceuticals with improved biological activity and lower toxicity than the currently available drugs. Biodegradable polymers and hydrogels are being widely employed in the medical field. New smart materials that can change colour, shape or function are finding use in the textiles industry. Similarly, silicon-based solar cells, lithium-sulphur batteries and hydrogen fuel cells are being employed in the energy industry.\nAppropriately crafted government policies are key to promoting innovation and economic growth. The government must also contribute to the creation of an eco-system that is conducive to innovation, promotes healthy competition, reduces barriers to entry for new businesses, and considers the factors concerned with ease of doing business, such as effective and efficient dispute resolution law, patent protection laws, and removal of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures for imports, exports and funds transfer. Innovation can also be promoted by offering tax incentives and grants to businesses for research and development.\nThe future of Pakistan lies in investing massively in such developing innovative fields. We must give the highest national priority to education, science, technology, innovation and commercialization to enhance our exports from the present $30 billion to $100 billion over the next decade. For this we must have a visionary, honest and technologically competent government to better understand the challenges and transition to a tec",

      "body": "Share on\nShare on\nArtificial intelligence (AI) will add approximately 15 trillion to the global economy by 2030 and around 97 million people will be employed in the AI industry by 2025. Given its explosive impact, one can say with certainty that the AI revolution is upon us. It has crossed over from a scientific niche to a technology that is the driving force behind most devices that we use daily. While AI-powered smartphones and devices are impressive, it is a fact that were just beginning to explore AI's true power.\nAn AI system mimics or simulates human-like intelligence. Typically, this requires three human cognitive abilities of learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. There are different ways an AI system can be implemented. One approach would be to use machine learningwhere large amounts of data are fed to a computer system and using statistical techniques it allows systems to learn and improve over time.\nEventually, the system would reach a stage where it would able to identify patterns and relationships in the data and uses this to make predictions or decisions.\nAnother approach is through expert systems where human expert-like decision-making is mimicked using a combination of rules and machine learning. One of the most prominent approaches is with neural networks which are modeled like the structures and functions of a human brain.\nIn general, AI models process vast amounts of data, find patterns, and use them to make predictions. For instance, to carry out automated tasks like photo ID verification, an AI model trained on a large number of facial images with associated features is used to examine pixels in an image or video and match it with a face to complete the validation process. Something that even humans do by putting in a conscious effort in most cases. Similarly, to teach AI-based multifunctional cognitive agents to communicate like humans, they are fed a large amount of text and dialogues.\nThere exists two forms of AIArtificial General Intelligence and Specialised Artificial Narrow Intelligence\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a type of AI that is capable of learning or understanding any intellectual task that a human being can. It is able to solve a range of complex problems in various environments. AGI is not trained to carry out a specific task, but it is able to learn new skills and knowledge on its own just like a human without explicit programming.\nArtificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), on the other hand, is a highly specialized form of AI. It is designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks in a given environment. ANI, unlike AGI is incapable of adapting to a new task on its own without explicit programming or training.\nOur lives are sprinkled with narrow AI from basic internet searches and product and content recommendations, to voice assistants like Alexa or Siri. Narrow AI can only accomplish what its trained to do. It makes decisions based on the data and objectives it is already trained on and does not have the ability to automatically learn new skills.\nOn the other hand, AGI can do everything that narrow AI is not capable of doing. One way to look at it would be to think of narrow AI as the foundation on which AGI is being built. It enables machines to apply human-like reasoning to accomplish various tasks.\nWe are, however, far away from developing the full extent of AGI. The human brains biological structure, the workings of various neural pathways, episodic and semantic memory, are very complex and a lot of our intelligence is derived from the physical embodiment and the interactions with our environment, to say the least. However, when AI, NLP, and deep learning are combined, they can get closer to replicating human intelligence than ever before. For instance, using these technologies, machines can be made to acquire cognitive abilities that enable them to a number of things like learn from experiencegain the ability to learn and integrate what they have learned from their transactions and interactions into new circumstances.\nIt can also plan like humans. Just like how we draw from life experiences to chalk out plans for our future. Similarly, AI-powered machines can learn from past experiences to create planned outcomes.\nAlong the same lines, even if a situation is outside the parameters of what it was taught, AGI can still analyze information and decide on a course of action.\nIf combined with with voice recognition, AGI can understand the wants, feelings, beliefs, and mental processes of human beings. With this kind of AI, machines are actually able to comprehend human behavior.\nBetween Narrow AI vs. General AI, which one is more unobtrusive?\nNarrow AI is typically thought to be less obtrusive than general AI because its made to handle specific tasks and is incapable of adapting or learning beyond those tasks. Since its less inclined to generate unexpected or undesired results, narrow AI is falsely perceived as less of a potential disruptor compared to AGI.\nIn reality, this can be different. Narrow AI is a huge disruptor as it leads to a lot of unintended consequences and because of the unobtrusive nature, it goes undetected before it is too late.\nTake the example of a narrow AI that is engaging users with content. Since one of the training objectives of the AI is to engage users and keep them hooked on to the content , Since anything that is outrageous could get more user traction  a user starts seeing content that is tailored to their fears and biases. Humans have a confirmation bias where they are more likely to agree with and consume things that provide some level of cognitive coherence. This unintended consequence polarizes societies and invalidates quite a lot of the humane attributes.\nGeneral AI, on the other hand, is intended to be flexible and adaptable and can learn about and adapt to diverse circumstances and contexts. As a result, general AI has the potential to be visibly more disruptive and is capable of taking actions and producing results based on its own learning and cognitive capabilities  making its application more noticeable than narrow AI.\nSafeguards for the AGI to prevent it from becoming a rogue AI working against humans like in the movies  is a hot topic in the sphere of AI and is something to be seen in the future to come. But in the short-term, narrow AI manipulating our human biases and emotions is definitely a disruptor as we are seeing around the world today.\nThe unobtrusiveness of an AI system ultimately depends on its design and execution, even if narrow AI is typically thought to be more so than general AI. A specific AI system that is intended to be accountable and transparent might be viewed as less obtrusive than a general AI system that is intended to be impenetrable and opaque. Explainable and ethical AI along with good regulatory frameworks should help in safeguarding the implications of narrow AI. \nEdited by Akanksha Sarma",

The sector has now pinned its hopes on Wednesdays Union Budget and expect Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to come up with announcements on helping the industry navigate through the manufacturing and pricing troubles.\nAccording to Invest India, the Indian retail market is projected to touch $2 trillion by 2032 from $690 billion in 2021. It is currently the 4th largest retail market in the world and is expected to create 25 million new jobs by 2030. Given this, the sector, which involves food, ecommerce and brick and mortar retailers, want more focus on manufacturing and pricing.\nFocus on Rural Markets\nRajesh Ramakrishnan, Managing Director, Perfetti Van Melle India, wants the budget to lay emphasis on rural markets and agriculture. One of the key expectations from Union Budget 2023 would be to fuel growth in the rural markets through a slew of initiatives around increased stimulus packages to boost farm income and greater number of infrastructure projects. Adequate investment in infrastructure, agriculture and social sectors will drive the pace of growth in the coming quarters. A key task for the Budget 2023 would be to develop sustainable growth models for increasing rural income so that there is a heightened demand for consumer products leading to a virtuous growth cycle.\nGST Relaxation\nAs for Vidit Aatrey, Founder & CEO of Meesho, the expectation is that the Budget will focus on GST relaxation for MSMEs. \"Budget 2023 gives our visionary government an opportunity to put our MSMEs in the fast lane, building on its proactive efforts to transform the small business economy. First, the government can bolster working capital for e-commerce suppliers by lowering GST on input services like logistics and facilitating refunds of accumulated input tax credit. Over April-November 2022, 2.9 lakh sellers on Meesho dealing in products that attract <18% GST saw input tax credit accumulation of Rs 265 crore.\nAatrey further said that expediting the implementation of GST relaxation norms for small online businesses will allow millions of them to realize their full potential.\nFurther, with the National Logistics Policy bringing down costs for the ecosystem and strengthening distribution networks, the government could leverage the unmatched reach of India Post and Indian Railways to help our MSMEs meet rising e-commerce demand from small towns and villages in a fast and reliable manner, thereby boosting their competitiveness,\" he added.\nSatish NS, President, Haier Appliances India, also has GST relaxation on his mind. The Union Budget 2023 will play an important role in bringing the white goods sector on track, amidst geopolitical uncertainties and rising inflation. Strategic actions to strengthen the manufacturing in India will be essential to maintain the current trajectory of steady economic growth in the country. The PLI scheme should continue forward which will push Make in India ahead. And as we move towards the summer season, we expect some relaxation in GST for air-conditioners from the upcoming Union Budget 2023.\nAttention to Branded Goods\nThe Budget is also expected to focus on the branded goods category. As per Suman Saha, CEO, Arrow, \"The Union Budget 2023-24 comes at a very relevant time, as the nation needs the right set of incentives and support measures to accelerate its recovery. The retail sector is a versatile industry and has emerged as one of the most dynamic and fast-paced industries due to the entry of several new players. This years budget must focus on policy alignment for the retail sector since the Indian consumer's purchasing power is increasing, and branded goods in categories like apparel, footwear, accessories and food.\nSupport for MSMEs \nSpeaking on the Make in India initiative playing a greater role for MSMEs, Lisa Suwal, CEO, Prasuma, said, Undoubtedly, the government has given a huge boost to Make in India in the previous budget through the introduction of the PLI (Production Linked Incentive) Scheme. However, this only benefits the larger players leading to a bigger disparity between the large and the smaller players. Our government should know that real innovation is happening at the smaller companies, and thus should look at the MSME space as well to provide such schemes.\nWe request the government to look at us as a growing sector, and provide us with schemes accordingly else it becomes tough to compete with the larger players. Suwal added.\nSharing the gem and jewellery industrys perspective, Eshwar Surana, MD, Raj Diamonds, says the budget should bridge the gap between larger and smaller players. Formulate policies that aim at bridging the gap between organised and unorganised players. The gem and jewellery industry is hopeful that the government will announce supporting measures and specific schemes for the industry in the forthcoming Budget as it holds huge potential to create jobs and increase exports year on year and become a major driver of economic growth. The need of the hour is to formulate policies and bring transparency that aim at bridging the gap between organised and unorganised players. We are also hoping for a further reduction in customs duty, which will regularize prices and in turn, boost customer demand.\nBoost for Infra\nAhmad Hushsham, Co-Founder, Yoho, wants the focus to be on infrastructure development too. The Indian government is committed to promoting economic growth and development, and this focus has continued since the pandemic. We hope to see a budget that outlines a plan for increasing economic growth along with more investment in infrastructure and incentives for corporate capital expenditure.\nAs per Hushsham, an important step in this direct",

      "description": "Everyone is talking about this chatty AI sensation. Its time to really understand whats going on.",
      "body": "|\nTippaPatt / Shutterstock\nEverybodys talking about ChatGPT, the OpenAI tool that writes poetry, prose, and even software code like a human.\nThe chatter mostly gravitates toward amazement, fear, and warning  amazement at what it can do, fear of cheating and replacement by robots, and warnings about the perils to humanity of outsourcing creativity to machines.\nAll that chatter misses the moment. In fact, ChatGPT (The GPT bit stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is less amazing, less scary, and needs fewer warnings than claimed by most of the media coverage. ChatGPT is an AI language model from San Francisco-based OpenAI. It can converse with a person via text and generate a wide range of content upon request.\nGenerative AI is by far the biggest trend in technology of this decade so far. So, lets understand it better by taking a look at six ChatGPT facts you probably havent heard.\n1. ChatGPT isnt uniquely capable\nChatGPT is special only because its public. There are other AI projects just as capable, or even more capable, that youve never tried.\nMajor tech companies, especially Google, Meta, and others  plus myriad startups and university departments  have developed generative AI tools at least as capable as ChatGPT. In some cases, competitors released limited versions of their AI; in others, they didnt release their technology for public use.\nMeta did release a chatbot called Blenderbot even before ChatGPT. But the bot was so cautious in how it was moderated that users found it boring to use.\nAll that caution stems from real-world misadventures. Microsoft released a chatbot called Tay years ago. It was trained on social media posts. The AI hoovered up content from online haters and trolls and spewed racism and vitriol to Microsofts embarrassment.\nGoogle fired an engineer last year for publicly (and falsely) proclaiming that Googles LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) was sentient.\nChatGPT is techs current flavor of the month because of OpenAIs boldness in releasing the tool to the public and some boldness in allowing the bot to address some, but not all, controversial subjects. Other companies are too cautious. But now that ChatGPT is getting so much attention, theyre scrambling to prepare their wares for everyone to use.\nGoogle reportedly issued an internal \ncode red\n to rush its AI offerings to public availability. The company plans to release some 20 new AI tools this year. Even Chinas Baidu is set to release a ChatGPT competitor in March.\nMeanwhile, a site called Futurepedia lists hundreds of AI tools you can try; many are based on ChatGPT, but others that are powerful competitors.\nChatGPT isnt uniquely powerful. Its just unique among the powerful AI systems for its boldness and availability.\n2. Microsoft controls OpenAI\nThe for-profit OpenAI LP company that makes ChatGPT is a subsidiary of the non-profit company OpenAI Incorporated. But OpenAI Incorporated does not own OpenAI LP.\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor, and the company is working on throwing another $10 billion at OpenAI LP, giving Microsoft a 49% stake. Only 2% of the company will be owned by its nonprofit parent company; all other investors will share the remaining 49%.\nMicrosoft is also actively working on building ChatGPT capability in Bing, Azure, PowerPoint, Outlook, and other products.\nThe bottom line is that Microsoft controls OpenAI.\n3. Most ChatGPT criticism isnt really about ChatGPT\nThe three biggest concerns about ChatGPT are that it 1) enables students to cheat; 2) will be used for unethical purposes, such as plagiarism and social engineering; and 3) sometimes gives false information.\nWe can dismiss the first two. Every new generation of generative AI that works like ChatGPT will be attended by tools that can detect AI-generated content. AI chatbots like ChatGPT are perfectly inevitable and will only get better. We were always going to have to deal with their unethical use.\nIn any event, the moral failings of humans arent the fault of AI tools.\nThe third criticism is misguided. When ChatGPT or other chatbots say false things, its only because the training datasets contained that false information haven't been caught yet by an extensive vetting process, which includes the current public beta. Slamming ChatGPT for bad data is like slamming movies as a medium because you saw a bad movie. And it misses the point.\nIn the future, companies will use generative AI either with their own data, or with thoroughly vetted data. In other words, the technology is one piece and the data is another.\nImagine an organization like the CIA pouring all its intelligence reports, political analysis and the transcript of millions of phone calls into something like ChatGPT. The power to quickly gain insights will be unimaginably high. The technology has breathtaking potential. But todays ChatGPT training data is irrelevant.\n4. ChatGPT is made of people\nIts tempting to perceive the use of text-based AI as interacting with a computers thoughts instead of a humans. In fact, projects like ChatGPT use human programming to harvest human-made content, which is then vetted and prioritized by humans. It therefore contains human errors, human biases and human conclusions.\n5. ChatGPT takes user skill to realize its full potential\nIn fact, all text-input generative AI tools need skillful inputs for maximum effect. The newish skill of prompt engineering  the art and science of knowing how to talk to each AI tool, will be akin to SEO  a cottage industry of tools and consultants will emerge for developing and using knowledge about which words products what result.\nPrompt engineering is a new speciality. But its also something most of us will dabble in. You can get started by checking out this so-called \n.\n6. Some industries already depend on ChatGPT\nSome types of professional writing is robotic, automatic, and formulaic  whether AI does it or not. Some professionals have already discovered that AI does this dull chore faster and cheaper.\nOne profession already addicted to ChatGPT is the real estate industry. When listing a property, there are only so many parameters one can use to describe a home for sale. The fundamentals include numerical data (square footage, total acreage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price, etc.) and descriptive and factual terms, such as renovated, open concept, formal dining room, etc.\nReal estate agents now just plug all that data into ChatGPT and let the AI write the overview for the listing websites.\nReal estate professionals arent unique, theyre just ahead of the curve. Many professionals will become totally dependent on AI tools.\nChatGPT is getting everyones attention. But the reality is that were in the earliest of the early days of generative AI. And understanding the reality of whats happening with this technology is everybodys business.\nRelated:",

      "description": "Key SEO takeaways from Google's 2020 paper on how text-generation models can be successfully used to detect low-quality content.",
      "body": "See terms.\nAn aside about spam prevalence\nI wanted to take a quick aside to discuss some interesting findings the authors stumbled upon. One is illustrated in the following figure (Figure 3 from the paper):\nIt's important to notice the score below each graph. A number toward 1.0 is moving to a confidence that the content is spam. What we're seeing then is that from 2017 onward  and spiking in 2019  there was a prevalence of low-quality documents.\nAdditionally, they found the impact of low-quality content was higher in some sectors than others (remembering that a higher score reflects a higher probability of spam).\nI scratched my head on a couple of these. Adult made sense, obviously.\nBut books and literature were a bit of a surprise. And so was health until the authors brought up Viagra and other \"adult health product\" sites as health\" and essay farms as \"literature\"  that is.\nTheir findings\nAside from what we discussed about sectors and the spike in 2019, the authors also found a number of interesting things that SEOs can learn from and must keep in mind, especially as we start to lean on tools like ChatGPT.\nLow-quality content tends to be lower in length (peaking at 3,000 characters).\nDetection systems trained to determine whether text was written by a machine or not are also good at classifying low vs. high-level content.\nThey call our content designed for rankings as a specific culprit, though I suspect they're referring to the trash we all know shouldn't be there.\nThe authors do not claim that this is an end-all-be-all solution, but rather a starting point and I'm sure they've moved the bar forward in the past couple of years.\nA note about AI-generated content\nLanguage models have likewise developed over the years. While GPT-3 existed when this paper was written, the detectors they were using were based on GPT-2 which is a significantly inferior model.\nGPT-4 is likely just around the corner and Google's Sparrow is set for release later this year. This means that not only is the tech getting better on both sides of the battleground (content generators vs. search engines), combinations will be easier to pull into play.\nCan Google detect content created by either Sparrow or GPT-4? Maybe.\nBut how about if it was generated with Sparrow and then sent to GPT-4 with a rewrite prompt?\nAnother factor that needs to be remembered is that the techniques used in this paper are based on auto-regressive models. Simply put, they predict a score for a word based on what they would predict that word to be given those that preceded it.\nAs models develop a higher degree of sophistication and start creating full ideas at a time rather than a word followed by another, the AI detection may slip.\nOn the other hand, the detection of simply crap content should escalate  which may mean that the only \"low quality\" content that will win, is AI-generated.\nOpinions expressed in this article are those of the guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land. Staff authors are listed here.",
