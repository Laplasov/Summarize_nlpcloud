      "body": "There is demand for metaverse and other futuristic projects from across sectors including banking, financial services, manufacturing, telecom, media, entertainment, healthcare and life sciences. The metaverse is a virtual, immersive environment that facilitates digital interactions.\nClient priorities\nAddressing the issue of hesitancy among companies to spend on exploratory metaverse and Web3 projects amid fears of a global recession, Mitra said that it will depend on what the client is using it for. The technology in itself is not what is being shut off, but the kind of applications it is needed for.\nThings like metaverse, AI, things like the work that we're doing around AR/VR and quantum will get us deals depending on what the (client) priorities are. The priorities now are more towards cost transformation and a little focus around customer experience and moving towards the cloud, he said.\nOn the 5G side, Tech Mahindra wants to steer the narrative towards connectivity, engineering, cloud and sustainability  the key pillars on which the company builds its solutions.\nCloud adoption\nIn December, Tech Mahindra launched Cloud Blazetech platform that Mitra said will help the company tap the next phase of cloud opportunities.\nThe first phase was about migrating things. Now the movement has become about applications, he said. The basics have been done, the cloud has been established, enterprise business applications have improved. Now, industrial applications are getting developed. That's how we are positioning our play.\nMitra expects cloud applications in areas such as customer connect, production, manufacturing, banking, and healthcare-related solutions.\nAutomation over hiring\nTech Mahindra reported the highest headcount reduction among IT companies in the third quarter of FY23, down by 6,844 from the previous quarter.\nMitra said this did not reflect a softening of demand but an increase in automation, which required fewer employees. He added that demand continues to remain strong so far.\nWe definitely feel that more and more automation, more and more technology, more and more process automation type of work will take precedence over the work that we're doing, and that's going to be the future. So that's more the reason for the headcount to have rationalised, rather than slowing demand. It's more technology and customer demand in terms of areas of work that we are delivering, Mitra said.",

      "description": "Discover if it's a good idea to create articles using ChatGPT as we put 5 AI content detective softwares to the test.",
      "body": "Bio\nFollow\nWe live in an age when AI technologies are booming, and the world has been taken by storm with the introduction of ChatGPT.\nChatGPT is capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks, but one that it does particularly well is writing articles. And while there are many obvious benefits to this, it also presents a number of challenges.\nIn my opinion, the biggest hurdle that AI-generated written content poses for the publishing industry is the spread of misinformation.\nChatGPT, or any other AI tool, may generate articles that may contain factual errors or are just flat-out incorrect.\nImagine someone who has no expertise in medicine starting a medical blog and using ChatGPT to write content for their articles.\nTheir content may contain errors that can only be identified by professional doctors. And if that blog content starts spreading over social media, or maybe even ranks in Search, it could cause harm to people who read it and take erroneous medical advice.\nAnother potential challenge ChatGPT poses is how students might leverage it within their written work.\nIf one can write an essay just by running a prompt (and without having to do any actual work), that greatly diminishes the quality of education  as learning about a subject and expressing your own ideas is key to essay writing.\nEven before the introduction of ChatGPT, many publishers were already generating content using AI. And while some honestly disclose it, others may not.\nBankRate started publishing articles written via AI, they even disclose it on the site. I have found 160+ articles. The first article I was able to find dated April 2022. It would interesting to see how these articles rank.\nOriginal finding by @tonythill. #AI\nAlso, Google recently changed its wording regarding AI-generated content, so that it is not necessarily against the companys guidelines.\nImage from Twitter, November 2022\nThis is why I decided to try out existing tools to understand where the tech industry is when it comes to detecting content generated by ChatGPT, or AI generally.\nI ran the following prompts in ChatGPT to generate written content and then ran those answers through different detection tools.\nWhat is local SEO? Why it is important? Best practices of Local SEO.\nWrite an essay about Napoleon Bonaparte invasion of Egypt.\nWhat are the main differences between iPhone and Samsung galaxy?\nHere is how each tool performed.\n1. Writer.com\nFor the first prompts answer, Writer.com fails, identifying ChatGPTs content as 94% human-generated.\nScreenshot from writer.com, January 2023\nFor the second prompt, it worked and detected it as AI-written content.\nScreenshot from writer.com, January 2023\nFor the third prompt, it failed again.\nScreenshot from writer.com, January 2023\nHowever, when I tested real human-written text, Writer.com did identify it as 100% human-generated very accurately.\n2. Copyleaks\ndid a great job in detecting all three prompts as AI-written.\nScreenshot from Copyleaks, January 2023\n3. Contentatscale.ai\ndid a great job in detecting all three prompts as AI-written, even though the first prompt, it gave a 21% human score.\nScreenshot from Contentscale.ai, January 2023\n4. Originality.ai\nOriginality.ai\ndid a great job on all three prompts, accurately detecting them as AI-written.\nAlso, when I checked with real human-written text, it did identify it as 100% human-generated, which is essential.\nScreenshot from Originality.ai, January 2023\nYou will notice that Originality.ai doesnt detect any plagiarism issues. This may change in the future.\nOver time, people will use the same prompts to generate AI-written content, likely resulting in a number of very similar answers. When these articles are published, they will then be detected by plagiarism tools.\n5. GPTZero\nThis non-commercial tool was built by Edward Tian, and specifically designed to detect ChatGPT-generated articles. And it did just that for all three prompts, recognizing them as AI-generated.\nScreenshot from GPTZero, January 2023\nUnlike other tools, it gives a more detailed analysis of detected issues, such as sentence-by-sentence analyses.\nScreenshot from GPTZero, January 2023\nOpenAIs AI Text Classifier\nAnd finally, lets see how OpenAi detects its own generated answers.\nFor the 1st and 3rd prompts, it detected that there is an AI involved by classifying it as possibly-AI generated.\nAI Text Classifier. Likely AI-generated\nBut surprisingly, it failed for the 2nd prompt and classified that as unlikely AI-generated. I did play with different prompts and found that, as of the moment, when checking it, few of the above tools detect AI content with higher accuracy than OpenAis own tool.\nAI Text Classifier. Unlikely AI-generated\nAs of the time of this check, they had released it a day before. I think in the future, they will fine tune it, and it will work much better.\nConclusion\nCurrent AI content generation tools are in good shape and are able to detect ChatGPT-generated content (with varying degrees of success).\nIt is still possible for someone to generate copy via ChatGPT and then paraphrase that to make it undetectable, but that might require almost as much work as writing from scratch  so the benefits arent as immediate.\nIf you think about ranking an article in Google written by ChatGPT, consider for a moment: If the tools we looked at above were able to recognize them as AI-generated, then for Google, detecting them should be a piece of cake.\nOn top of that, Google has quality raters who will train their system to recognize AI-written articles even better by manually marking them as they find them.\nSo, my advice would be not to build your content strategy on ChatGPT-generated content, but use it merely as an assistant tool.\nMore resources:",

      "body": "Wrapping up\nFor many internet users, ChatGPT became the first-ever experience using no-code AI instruments. Thanks to an impressive kit of opportunities it unlocks, it rapidly made headlines in November 2022.\nWhile excited users immediately stated that it would be able to replace any web developer and content creator, ChatGPT has its limitations. As such, is it a real game-changer? And how can it advance the cryptocurrency experience for newcomers and OGs in Web3?\nChatGPT is changing crypto sphere right now: Highlights\nSince its launch in November 2022, the ChatGPT bot has been surrounded by heated debates over its role in the global digital ecosystem as well as debates about ethical, technical and commercial aspects of its usage.\nDeveloped by U.S.-based corporation OpenAI, ChatGPT is a text bot powered by artificial intelligence;\nChatGPT is designed to answer questions using information from publicly available sources on the internet;\nLargely, ChatGPT became popular due to its ability to write simple code templates in different programming languages and to explain complex technical concepts in plain English;\nChatGPT can be used for free, but only paid plans (starting from $23 per month) work during periods of maximum traffic;\nFor cryptocurrency users, ChatGPT can provide newbie-level manuals, brief explanations, how-tos and so on;\nFor cryptocurrency developers, ChatGPT can write software primitives crucial for DeFi, NFT use cases, running full nodes, checking blockchain status, etc.;\nChatGPT's success has already triggered a rally of altcoins somehow associated with AI or related technologies.\nAs such, ChatGPT can significantly lower barriers of entry to the cryptocurrency segment for blockchain developers, average users and traders. Meanwhile, as the product is still in its infancy, both ChatGPT and all AI-powered chat platforms should be used with caution and responsibility.\nAds\nAds\nWhat is ChatGPT and why is it so popular?\nChat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, commonly known as ChatGPT, is a chatbot that leverages GPT-3, a family of large language models. ChatGPT's performance was improved by a team of human trainers with two approaches  namely, supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\nIn the supervised learning phase, the model provides conversations where trainers played two roles: texts by both an \"AI assistant\" and \"respondent\" were written by human authors from various countries;\nIn the reinforcement learning phase, human editors ranked responses from the first phase to prioritize responses from \"AI assistants.\" This step allowed the launch \"reward system\" that fine-tuned ChatGPT to align with OpenAI goals.\nFor an average user, ChatGPT looks not unlike a normal chat with AI-powered assistants in online banks, e-commerce platforms and educational web portals. Users just ask questions to find unbiased and accurate answers.\nMeanwhile, there are a number of striking advantages that ChatGPT has over previous generations of AI-powered tools. Simply put, it is (1) far more powerful and (2) truly general-purpose: it can solve more puzzles and do it better than all of its mainstream predecessors.\nChatGPT is available in a user-friendly no-code interface and has had free tariffs since the very first days of its prototype testing. Thus, ChatGPT is an exciting combination of accessibility and versatility for every user with no regard to his/her level of tech expertise.\nWho created ChatGPT?\nChatGPT was created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based research and development team that includes two separate bodies: nonprofit OpenAI Inc. (OpenAI Inc.) and its for-profit fully-owned subsidiary OpenAI Limited Partnership (OpenAI LP). Initially, OpenAI started as an R&D initiative focused on studying the potential of AI for the possible benefit of humanity (so called the \"Friendly AI\" concept). Since its launch in December 2015, the organization has been helmed by leading tech entrepreneurs and investors including Sam Altman, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.\nIn 2021, the OpenAI team made headlines with its DALLE 2, a deep learning model that creates realistic images with only short text descriptions. Just like ChatGPT in the prototype phase, DALLE 2 has only free tariffs and triggered massive hype on social media.\nChatGPT itself was unveiled to the general public on Nov. 30, 2022. In less than seven days, its user count eclipsed one million users, which is an unprecedented metric for digital applications. In mid-December, the service was down due to an enormous traffic problem, but the team fixed its issues. In early January 2023, the platform introduced its first-ever paid tariff and shared its plans to launch the GPT-4 update in late 2023.\nMicrosoft partners with OpenAI: Why is this important?\nSince the launch of the first OpenAI projects, its development has been backed by U.S. digital heavyweight Microsoft. The IT mogul co-led the rounds for OpenAI in 2019 and 2021 and provided the computational resources of Microsoft Azure platform for ChatGPT testing.\nAs such, the announcement of \"a multiyear, multibillion dollar investment\" in OpenAI made by Microsoft representatives in January 2023 triggered another phase of hype around the application. Within the \"collaboration\" (the tech media immediately called it \"acquisition\"), OpenAI and Microsoft will work together on three workloads. First of all, Microsoft will accelerate direct investments in OpenAI research and development to speed up the delivery of new products.\nThen, Microsoft will deploy OpenAIs models across its array of consumer products. This, in turn, will advance the user experience of Microsoft Azure customers and users of other products by Microsoft. Also, Microsoft Azure will be an exclusive cloud computations provider for all OpenAI projects.\nTo sum up, the support of Microsoft will help OpenAI to cement its domination in the segment of AI solutions for retail and institutional clients.\nChatGPT for crypto: Effects and challenges\nFirst and foremost, ChatGPT became popular thanks to its opportunity to answer questions in a newbie-friendly way using plain English. As such, it can potentially change the narrative in tech education, including the blockchain segment as well.\nChatGPT for crypto adoption\nChatGPT can describe the majority of cryptocurrency concepts in the ELI5 manner. For instance, heres how it explains what proof of stake is, a mainstream type of blockchain consensus used by Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and so on:\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism used by some blockchain networks to validate transactions and produce new blocks. Instead of using computational power (as in Proof-of-Work), PoS relies on validators holding a certain amount of tokens to stake or lock up as collateral, and they are then chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks proportional to the amount they have staked. This makes the validation process more energy-efficient and reduces the risk of centralization compared to PoW.\nOne can notice that the answer i",

From my early years I showed a taste for watching the news and staying informed. I was a graduate of the 2014  2018 generation of the degree in Journalism, from the Autonomous University of Sinaloa (UAS), the first in that career since its opening. Regarding professional experience, I was able to gain learning during a period of six months in the sports area of the Noroeste newspaper, where I did professional internships. Later, I had the opportunity to spend another six months in the ranks of Radio Sinaloa, particularly in the news program Informativo Puro Sinaloa, of the state government. There I covered local issues, recorded voice for the newscast, contributed content for other broadcasts and had live participation. Since 2020 I have been at Debate, a company that opened the doors for me to integrate as a web reporter, and months later to hold the position of Editor on the Debate.com.mx site.",

      "body": "The past few years have seen an explosion in applications of artificial intelligence to creative fields. A new generation of image and text generators is delivering impressive results. Now AI has also found applications in music, too.\r\n\r\nLast week, a group of researchers at Google released MusicLM  an AI-based music generator that can convert text prompts into audio segments. It's another example of the rapid pace of innovation in an incredible few years for creative AI.\r\n\r\nWith the music industry still adjusting to disruptions caused by the internet and streaming services, there's a lot of interest in how AI might change the way we create and experience music.Big Tech and Digital Ads Revenue are in Decline: Heres Why\r\n\r\nAutomating music creation\r\n\r\nA number of AI tools now allow users to automatically generate musical sequences or audio segments. Many are free and open source, such as Google's Magenta toolkit.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most familiar approaches in AI music generation are: 1. continuation, where the AI continues a sequence of notes or waveform data, and 2. harmonisation or accompaniment, where the AI generates something to complement the input, such as chords to go with a melody.Google Parent Alphabet Posts Disappointing Q4 Profit: Here's Why\r\n\r\nSimilar to text- and image-generating AI, music AI systems can be trained on a number of different data sets. You could, for example, extend a melody by Chopin using a system trained in the style of Bon Jovi  as beautifully demonstrated in OpenAI's MuseNet.\r\n\r\nSuch tools can be great inspiration for artists with blank page syndrome, even if the artist themselves provide the final push. Creative stimulation is one of the immediate applications of creative AI tools today.\r\n\r\nBut where these tools may one day be even more useful is in extending musical expertise. Many people can write a tune, but fewer know how to adeptly manipulate chords to evoke emotions, or how to write music in a range of styles.\r\n\r\nAlthough music AI tools have a way to go to reliably do the work of talented musicians, a handful of companies are developing AI platforms for music generation.\r\n\r\nBoomy takes the minimalist path: users with no musical experience can create a song with a few clicks and then rearrange it. Aiva has a similar approach, but allows finer control; artists can edit the generated music note-by-note in a custom editor.\r\n\r\nThere is a catch, however. Machine learning techniques are famously hard to control, and generating music using AI is a bit of a lucky dip for now; you might occasionally strike gold while using these tools, but you may not know why.\r\n\r\nAn ongoing challenge for people creating these AI tools is to allow more precise and deliberate control over what the generative algorithms produce.\r\n\r\nNew ways to manipulate style and sound Music AI tools also allow users to transform a musical sequence or audio segment. Google Magenta's Differentiable Digital Signal Processing library technology, for example, performs timbre transfer.\r\n\r\nTimbre is the technical term for the texture of the sound  the difference between a car engine and a whistle. Using timbre transfer, the timbre of a segment of audio can be changed.\r\n\r\nSuch tools are a great example of how AI can help musicians compose rich orchestrations and achieve completely new sounds.\r\n\r\nIn the first AI Song Contest, held in 2020, Sydney-based music studio Uncanny Valley (with whom I collaborate), used timbre transfer to bring singing koalas into the mix. Timbre transfer has joined a long history of synthesis techniques that have become instruments in themselves.\r\n\r\nTaking music apart Music generation and transformation are just one part of the equation. A longstanding problem in audio work is that of source separation. This means being able to break an audio recording of a track into its separate instruments.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not perfect, AI-powered source separation has come a long way. Its use is likely to be a big deal for artists; some of whom won't like that others can pick the lock on their compositions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, DJs and mashup artists will gain unprecedented control over how they mix and remix tracks. Source separation start-up Audioshake claims this will provide new revenue streams for artists who allow their music to be adapted more easily, such as for TV and film.\r\n\r\nArtists may have to accept this Pandora's box has been opened, as was the case when synthesizers and drum machines first arrived and, in some circumstances, replaced the need for musicians in certain contexts.\r\n\r\nBut watch this space, because copyright laws do offer artists protection from the unauthorised manipulation of their work. This is likely to become another grey area in the music industry, and regulation may struggle to keep up.\r\n\r\nNew musical experiences Playlist popularity has revealed how much we like to listen to music that has some functional utility, such as to focus, relax, fall asleep, or work out to.\r\n\r\nThe start-up Endel has made AI-powered functional music its business model, creating infinite streams to help maximise certain cognitive states.\r\n\r\nEndel's music can be hooked up to physiological data such as a listener's heart rate. Its manifesto draws heavily on practices of mindfulness and makes the bold proposal we can use new technology to help our bodies and brains adapt to the new world, with its hectic and anxiety-inducing pace.\r\n\r\nOther start-ups are also exploring functional music. Aimi is examining how individual electronic music producers can turn their music into infinite and interactive streams.\r\n\r\nAimi's listener app invites fans to manipulate the system's generative parameters such as intensity or texture, or deciding when a drop happens. The listener engages with the music rather than listening passively.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say how much heavy lifting AI is doing in these applications  potentially little. Even so, such advances are guiding companies' visions of how musical experience might evolve in the future.\r\n\r\nThe future of music The initiatives mentioned above are in conflict with several long-established conventions, laws and cultural values regarding how we create and share music.\r\n\r\nWill copyright laws be tightened to ensure companies training AI systems on artists' works compensate those artists? And what would that compensation be for? Will new rules apply to source separation? Will musicians using AI spend less time making music, or make more music than ever before? If there's one thing that's certain, it's change.\r\n\r\nAs a new generation of musicians grows up immersed in AI's creative possibilities, they'll find new ways of working with these tools.\r\n\r\nSuch turbulence is nothing new in the history of music technology, and neither powerful technologies nor standing conventions should dictate our creative future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Infinix Zero Ultra has a decent set of specifications on paper, but does the phone justify its high asking price?

      "body": "Google employees protest against job cuts, low pay in US\nThe two co-founders of Instagram unveiled a new app they have been developing since leaving the social media behemoth four years ago.\nThe Artifact app, developed by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, is described as \"a personalised news feed using the latest AI tech.\" Those who are interested in checking out Artifact must receive an invitation, although they can currently join a waitlist, Systrom stated in a tweet on Tuesday.\nIn September 2018, the entrepreneurs quit Instagram after their 8-years stint with the Facebook-owned business. There were reportedly tensions between the co-founders and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, despite Systrom and Krieger publicly stating that they left the company to \"explore their creativity and curiosity again.\" In 2020, the two also launched a website to track the COVID-19 outbreak after they had left Instagram.\nOn a \"For You\" page, Artifact provides news articles that users may find interesting.\nThe launch of Artifact demonstrates how AI is continuing to have a bigger impact on how people use social media platforms to consume content, including news. For instance, the well-known short-form video app TikTok utilises an algorithm to present users with videos they might find interesting on the \"For You\" page. When speaking with Systrom about Artifact, Platformer's Casey Newton compared it to \"TikTok for text,\" though you could also describe it as \"Google Reader reborn as a mobile app\" or even \"a surprise attack on Twitter.\"\nUsers of Artifact get a feed of selected news articles from publishers like The New York Times. The app will display related articles after a user clicks on a story as it gets to know the user's reading interests. Newton was also informed by Systrom that Artifact has additional features, such as a feed of news articles posted by people you follow that also include their comments on the story. Users of Artifact can also have private direct message conversations with friends about the news.\nThis is how it goes: Users are prompted to select 10 or more topics when they join up in order to customise their news feed. The app tracks how much of an article a user has read and features a \"For You\" page similar to TikTok. For instance, the \"For You\" page of the app will display more articles about interior design as the user reads more of those stories. A feature of the app named \"Headlines\" presents the most recent news stories.\nFacebook\n, Twitter, and other social media platforms have already embraced AI to suggest posts, images, and videos to users, so Artifact will need to prove how its new app is unique. The Google News app also features \"For You\" and \"Headline\" sections.\nIn addition to fierce competition, using AI to recommend content raises issues with mental health. Last year, The Wall Street Journal looked into TikTok's algorithm and discovered that the app was oversaturating teens with material related to eating disorders. In a practice known as \"doom-scrolling,\" people have also become addicted to scrolling through their social media feeds looking for the bad news.\nStartups are embracing AI despite the possible risks it may carry. Systrom stated that he believes algorithmic predictions will dominate social media in the future.",

      "body": "AI and experiments: new possibilities emerge in 2023\nAI and experiments: new possibilities emerge in 2023\nBy\nFebruary 3, 2023 - 5 minutes\nBy Markus Gershater, co-founder and chief scientific officer, Synthace\nThe buzz surrounding generative AI has reached fever pitch. Its a technology so unique and fascinating that the breadth of possibility has done that rare thing of exciting both consumer and business imaginations at the same time.\nIts not hard to see why.\nIn the life sciences, AI has made waves so large that many are making entirely credible claims that the continued development of these tools will completely transform the world of biological research. And I agree. Ever the skeptical scientist, however, I am inclined to ask what the limits are to any new methodology or technology, no matter the surrounding enthusiasm.\nWe have, in recent years, seen promising results emerge from existing high-quality datasets that were collected in a systematic way (e.g. genome sequences, and protein structures). There are two main misconceptions about todays generative AI, however: that it can only work on high-quality data, or that it needs lots of it. In truth, even small amounts of low-quality data show promise. Thats why AI could eventually prove valuable for research at most every scale.\nBut what of the data we dont have? I dont mean the data we havent gotten around to collecting yet, but rather the data that we cant currently collect at all: our blind spots. The question I have been asking myself, more and more, is this: what data do we have about experimentation itself?\nContent continues below\nRelated Content\nToward AI-enabled experimentation\nBefore we answer that question, lets first imagine a future where AI is deeply integrated into the process of experimentation. Combining data from the literature, all of your institutional experimental data and metadata, and integrated with fully automated laboratories, the impact of AI on the power and possibility of our experiments could be significant.\nThere are two questions that AI-enabled experimentation could conceivably answer in the context of experimentation. The first: whats the best experiment for me to be running next? The second: whats the best way to improve the experiments Im already runningfor accuracy, speed, cost, complexity, insight, or some combination of the above?\nAI is incredibly adept at noticing patterns that humans cant see. Lets say we first trained an AI on the data of all available scientific literature (something that Daniel Goodwin speculates may soon happen to all 100TB/88MM papers in SciHub). Then, lets say we also trained it on every available data point about the experiments youve already run, and are running, within your organization. What would it see that we could not? Could it see a missed opportunity to run an experiment in an area wed never considered? Could it make suggestions about how your experiments could be an order of magnitude more insightful at lower cost? Could it predict the probability of success in an experiment youre planning?\nThe possibilities are exciting. Theres just one problem right now, though: where are you getting those available data points about the experiments that run in your lab? Experiments as we understand them today are inherently analog in nature. As a concept, they predominantly live in the mind of the scientist who must keep everything coherent and on track. The rest is scattered around the lab. There are designs in notebooks and word documents. Calculations on paper and spreadsheets. Device instructions in scripting software. Sample information in inventory systems. Data in databases. Sometimes even rough notes, written down and forgotten.\nWould a digital experiment be possible?\nExperiments: analog vs digital\nExperiments can either be manual, or automated. To move at speed, many companies look to automation to speed up their experiments. But automation is difficult to get off the ground in a lab. Even when you do, its usually limited to discrete tasks. Liquid handling orchestration bills itself as more sophisticated, but neither automation nor orchestration has any connection with the intent, design, or context of the broader experiment.\nContent continues below\nRelated Content\nIn short, lab automation knows the how, but not the why.\nWhile point solutions like these and others have long been considered one of the best ways to digitize a lab, the approach feels limiting in the era of AI. While AI could absolutely improve the efficiency of automation scripts, or find ways to improve certain automation actions, this is likely to be as far as things will go without a different underlying approach.\nThe different approach I believe will emerge in 2023? Digital experiments.\nNo longer limited to a purely analog domain, the digital experiment would be designed and planned in one place. It would be created and edited from anywhere in the world and replicated in any lab. It would integrate with equipment to run powerful multifactorial workflows, then automatically gather data and metadata for analysis. It would capture and connect the context and intent of each experiment, helping others understand them with accuracy. It would be a powerhouse for collaboration, acting as a common resource for everyone who needs to understand an experimentincluding artificial intelligence.\nDigital experiment would enable AI to identify complex patterns that cut across the intent, the execution and the data of an experiment. It would enable an AI to make powerful predictions that could help scientists improve the power of their experiments or generate better insights from their experimental activities.\nAt their core, digital experiments would be a powerful, unified blueprint for biological experimentation in life science R&D. When they emerge, they will begin to unlock the full power of AI and cloud computing in lab-based experimentation. Even more than this, they will become a way for scientists, technicians, engineers, data scientists, bioinformaticians, and leadership to work from a shared model in a way that was previously impossible.\nExperiments have always been the foundation of our biological understanding. If we can bring them into the digital domain, their potential will be transformative.\nExplore Related Topics:",

      "description": "Researchers have developed a new tool that uses AI to predict the efficacy of various genome-editing repair options.",
      "body": "CRISPR\n/Cas9 gene scissors directly address the cause of the disease in the DNA. The scissors are used in the laboratory to make targeted modifications to the genetic material in cell lines and model organisms and to study biological processes.\nA further development of this classic CRISPR/Cas9 method is prime editing. Unlike conventional gene scissors, which create a break in both strands of the DNA molecule, prime editing cuts and repairs DNA on a single strand only. The prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) precisely targets the relevant site in the genome and provides the new genetic information, which is then transcribed by a translation enzyme and incorporated into the DNA.\nFinding the most efficient DNA repair options\nPrime editing promises to be an effective method of repairing disease-causing mutations in patients genomes. However, when it comes to applying it successfully, it is important to minimize unintended side effects such as errors in DNA correction or alteration of DNA elsewhere in the genome. According to initial studies, prime editing leads to a significantly lower number of unintended changes than conventional CRISPR/Cas9 approaches.\nHowever, researchers currently still have to spend a significant amount of time optimizing the pegRNA for a specific target in the genome.\nThere are over 200 repair possibilities per mutation. In theory, we would have to test every single design option each time to find the most efficient and accurate pegRNA, said Gerald Schwank, professor at the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Zurich (UZH).\nContent continues below\nRelated Content\nAnalyzing a large dataset with AI\nSchwank and his research group needed to find an easier solution. Together with Michael Krauthammer, UZH professor at the Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, and his team, they developed a method that can predict the efficiency of pegRNAs. By testing more than 100,000 different pegRNAs in human cells, they were able to generate a comprehensive prime editing data set. This enabled them to determine which properties of a pegRNA  such as the length of the DNA sequence, the sequence of DNA building blocks or the shape of the DNA molecule  positively or negatively influence the prime editing process.\nThe team developed an AI-based algorithm to recognize patterns in the pegRNA of relevance for efficiency. Based on these patterns, the trained tool can predict both the effectiveness and accuracy of genome editing with a particular pegRNA.\nIn other words, the algorithm can determine the most efficient pegRNA for correcting a particular mutation, Krauthammer said. The tool has already been successfully tested in human and mice cells and is freely available to researchers.\nLong-term goal: repairing hereditary diseases\nFurther pre-clinical studies are still needed before the new prime editing tool can be used in humans. However, the researchers are confident that in the foreseeable future it will be possible to use prime editing to repair the DNA mutations of common inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis or metabolic diseases.\nThe tool can be accessed by researchers at https://pridict.it.\nThe study was supported by the University of Zurich Research Priority Program Human Reproduction Reloaded and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nContent continues below\nRelated Content\nNicolas Mathis & Ahmed Allam et al.

Tim Cook also took a methodical approach to invest in futuristic tech like AI and augmented/virtual reality.\nMehul Reuben Das\nFebruary 03, 2023 13:12:36 IST\nWhen tech companies like Google and Microsoft went berserk during their hiring spree, Apple took a more careful approach. Tim Cook also took a methodical approach to invest in futuristic tech like AI and augmented/virtual reality. Image Credit: AFP\nGoogle laid off 12,000 employees in January alone and about a month ago, Amazon announced that it will remove 18,000 employees, and has already laid of over 10,000 people. Microsoft, similarly, has laid off about 10,000 employees. All in all, over 1,50,000 people working in tech are likely to be laid by March 2023.\nAnd then theres Apple While the global tech industry is seeing an unprecedented level of mass firings, Apple, has somehow managed to survive all this commotion.\nSpeaking to the Wall Street Journal, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he views layoffs as a last resort kind of thing.\nCook stated that Apple has had to alter its spending and recruiting plans in response to broader economic conditions. For example, the corporation is monitoring expenses extremely closely and is reducing recruiting in certain sectors while continuing to hire in others. However, Cook explained that layoffs are a last resort and that the corporation would prefer to control expenses in other ways.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, when the tech industry was going through a boom of sorts, Apple, like other organisations in the tech space hired a lot of people. However, they were a little conservative during their hiring spree. While its competitors increased their headcount by anywhere in the 57 per cent to 100 per cent  range between September 2019 to September 2022, Apples headcount grew by around 20 per cent.\nTheres also the fact that Apple has a  lean approach for employee perks (at least in comparison to other tech companies), as well as its very methodical approach to investing in projects with less certain futures. For instance, Apple is investing heavily in things like AR and VR, but its doing so at a slower pace than companies like Meta and Facebook invest in new areas.\nDespite all of this, Tim Cook revealed that layoffs at Apple cant be ruled out completely, but they wont go about the way other tech companies have done it, unless it is absolutely necessary.\nFor the time being, however, they dont appear to be something in the immediate future. There are also other ways Apple can reduce its headcount, such as attrition: simply not replacing people who leave the company.\nRead all the",

      "body": "Print Article\nText size\nWhile AI may soon evolve to produce essays even more complex and eloquent than the products of college English classes, the writing process will never become an exercise in futility, writes Rachel Shin.\nTimothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\nAbout the author: Rachel Shin is an English major at Yale.\nMy Uber driver pitied me the other day, when I told him that I was a college English major. Artificial intelligence is coming for me, he said, and I must be scared now. He was referring to the recent explosion of AI-generated writing, namely by ChatGPT, which can instantly produce extremely sophisticated and novel text on any topic, in any style. If anyone can prompt a computer to produce college-level essays and poetry in perfect iambic pentameter, whats the point of a writing education?\nMy driver had a point. Some professors have predicted that the new technology heralds the imminent elimination of essay writing in education. ChatGPTs writing is advanced and clean, and could be considered A-caliber in high school and some undergraduate courses. To be honest, I am scared. But my worry isnt about chatbots taking my future jobs. I fear that the fundamental merit of writing education may be getting lost amid anti-cheating alarm.\nTheres cause for concern. Many schools have already seen students use the tool to complete essay assignments, and, in an effort to prevent AI based plagiarism, have begun pivoting away from writing. Some educators have opted to diversify their assignments by implementing more projects or oral presentations, or to restrict written assignments to only in-class essays.\nAs an English student, I believe schools should adapt the education system to AI tools, but not merely to prevent plagiarism. The goal should be to preserve writing as a pillar of intellectual development. Chatbots will continue to rapidly advance and proliferate. OpenAI is already planning to release GPT-4, ChatGPTs successor. If education continues to skirt technologys potential misuse by resorting to nonwritten assignments, writing will eventually vanish as a cornerstone of learning.\nSome have questioned if high school and basic college writing is even worth defending, if it is so effortlessly replicated by chatbots. Is ChatGPT simply the latest iteration of aids like the calculator or spellcheck? What value does writing have for students who have no interest in it, if the job can be automated?\nEven for those who are not attracted to writing as a craft, the skill is invaluable to students as a process by which to better understand their subject, their world, and themselves. To write clearly, one must think clearly. In turn, writing further refines ones thoughts. As an English student, writing has illuminated texts for me that initially appeared impenetrable. Last semester I read Form, in which poet Jennifer Chang says grief is a row of eggs waiting in the cold to / lose their shape. Only when posed with writing about the poem was I forced to develop ideas about how the eggs, like grief and poetry, resist resolution. The process of writing caused me to reflect on my own emotions in ways that simply reading would never have provoked. Reducing emphasis on writing in order to stymie plagiarism is shortsighted. It would foster, not forestall, educational decline. It would turn out a generation of students who are less prepared to form, identify, or articulate their opinions lucidly.\nSo how can educators preserve writing even as it is actively assailed? Rather than abandon the city under siege, teachers should defend it with renewed investment. High schools might find inspiration in a university-inspired intensive focus model, an approach I have found great value in. In Reading and Writing the Modern Essay, one of the most popular English courses at Yale, students participate in essay workshops in which they carefully explain their authorial decisions, from broad-stroke thesis analyses down to diction choices. They receive comments from peers and their professor on how their paper might be improved. Opposite to the instantaneous synthesis of chatbot writing, seminar-style writing is slow, meticulously considered, and iterative. It also emphasizes a collaborative approach to writing, a method that can reveal the joy of writing for craft and as a fruitful enterprise rather than a chore. The students final draft embodies the richness of rigorous discussion and revision, but, more importantly, the learning model isolates and develops the critical thought process which underlies good writing. Students learn how to write not only to communicate to the world, but to learn how to think.\nWhile AI may soon evolve to produce essays even more complex and eloquent than the products of college English classes, the writing process will never become an exercise in futility. In 1997, the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game; soon, we may well see ChatGPTs successors rival the finest human writers. That will not make writing a hollow pursuit, just as the satisfaction of a well-played chess match has not diminished since its strategies were algorithmically perfected. The bedrock of writinglucid reasoning, logical architecture, and elegancewill remain necessary for each generation. Education cant lose sight of that.\nGuest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barrons and MarketWatch newsroom. They reflect the perspective and opinions of the authors.

      "body": "Microsoft has recently introduced its Microsoft Teams Premium with OpenAIs ChatPT features. This collaboration will provide users more intelligent and personalised features such as intelligent recap, AI created notes and more.Here are 10 points on how Microsoft Teams will change with ChatGPT:Intelligent recapWith the Microsoft Teams infusing AI throughout the meeting experiences, users will receive intelligent recap in Teams premium. Now users can access automatically generated meeting notes, recommended tasks and personalised highlights to get information most important to them.AI-generated chaptersWith the introduction of intelligent recap, now users will be able to get AI-generated chapters. These chapters will divide the meeting into sections for choosing the most relevant content later. It will save time spent reviewing the meeting recordings. Moreover, the feature will automatically generate meeting chapters based on the meeting transcript too.Personalised timeline makersThere might be particular points in a meeting that users need to revisit. The personalised timeline markers can be called out when a host joined or left a meeting in the meeting recording, so it can be quickly clicked upon and listened to when something was missed. Personalised timeline markers will expand to include when someones name was mentioned and when a screen was shared.Speaker timeline markersThese personalised meeting highlights will expand to include speaker timeline markers that will show who spoke during the meeting, when they spoke, and allow users to jump to that moment. As per Microsoft, speaker timeline markers are intelligently organised by who you work most closely with, so users will never miss feedback shared.Live translationsAI will also help with people who natively speak different languages. With live translations (for captions) now available in Teams Premium, users get AI-powered real-time translations from 40 spoken languages. According to the company, meeting participants can read captions in their own language. Notably, only the meeting organiser needs to have Teams Premium for all meeting attendees to enjoy live translations.Personalised branded meetingsWith Teams Premium, now users will get personalised meetings. Branded meetings will allow users to see the logo and colors of their organisation when they join the meeting, and allow their brand colors to be infused in the meeting itself. According to Microsoft, during the meeting, Teams Premium users will be able to enable brand-approved organisation backgrounds and organisation together mode scenes, so that this will make their company and their people unique. Microsoft reveals that these organisation backgrounds and together mode scenes are available now and branded meetings will be available in mid-February 2023.Customised meeting templatesNow with Teams Premium, IT admins will be able to create customised meeting templates such as a client call, brainstorming meeting, or help desk call. These templates will automatically include the correct settings to reduce the time and thought process it takes to create and get the meeting right.Custom user policy packagesIt can be difficult to assign meetings, messages, and app policies individually. Now with custom user policy packages, IT will be able to save time by creating a customised bundle of policies for users with similar roles in the organisation. It will simplify, streamline and prove to be time saving to manage policies for groups of users across an organisation.Advanced meeting protectionWith advanced meeting protection in Teams Premium, users will be able to easily upgrade safeguards for confidential business meetings without hampering the meeting experience. New meeting options, like watermarking to prevent leaks and limiting to record, will give users additional protections to keep their discussion private.Meeting organisers can leverage a unique watermark over attendee screen shares and video feeds to present and display sensitive information. Moreover, in extremely sensitive meetings that require disabling some of the core meeting features for an advanced encryption option, IT-enabled users can apply an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) option to the meeting.Virtual appointmentsWith Teams Premium, it will now be easy to connect with customers and manage the end-to-end customer experience with Virtual Appointments in Teams. This will save time and resources on additional add-on or point solutions. Users can communicate with customers with no extra cost. The feature will allow external attendees to join virtual, branded lobby rooms through text messages or email on any device browser especially without them having to download an app.",

      "body": "News\nMicrosoft Viva Sales generative AI experience\nMicrosoft is enhancing Viva Sales by incorporating some AI capabilities into it, allowing it to provide intelligent suggestions based on the needs of the sellers.\nThe companion application, which works with Dynamics and Salesforce CRM solutions, will no longer just provide simple recommendations and insights. According to Microsoft, it leveraged the power of Azure OpenAI Service and GPT to help be capable of composing intelligent email responses. According to Microsoft, with the new AI capability of the app, sellers can free up even more time to focus on priorities.\nThe responses that will be provided will cover different scenarios, including inquiry and proposal creation. And to ensure the quality of the content of the email responses, Microsoft said that the composition would be based on customer records and Office email software data.\nWhen responding to an email, Viva Sales provides sellers in-the-moment suggested responses based upon categories such as make a proposal, reply to an inquiry, or suggest your own.\nexplains\nLori Lamkin, Corporate Vice President of Dynamics 365 Customer Experience Platform. The seller simply selects the option to suit their needs and a reply is generated for the seller to review, edit to their liking, and send. The reply is enriched with the combined data from Microsoft Graphwhich provides access to people-centric data and insights in the Microsoft Cloud, including Microsoft 365, Windows, and Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security, and the customer relationship management (CRM) system (Microsoft Dynamics 365 or Salesforce).\nAside from Viva Sales, other Microsoft products are also expected to get AI integrations. This week, a\nreport\nrevealed that the software company is working on incorporating GPT-4 into Bing instead of the common ChatGPT version. According to people familiar with the matter, this will allow the search engine to provide faster AI-based responses that are more detailed and more human-like. This week, Microsoft also\nlaunched\nthe ChatGPT-powered Teams Premium, which offers some intelligent features, including live translated captions, automatically generated meeting notes, recommended tasks, and personalized highlights.\nThe integration of OpenAIs works into Microsofts services and products is the fruit of the giants investment in the AI research laboratory.

With AI research booming across a range of fields, it is expected to play an increasing role in other ways to diagnose cancer.\nFebruary 03, 2023, 12:30 IST\nParis: Could humanity finally be gaining the upper hand in our age-old fight against cancer?\nRecent scientific and medical advances have added several new weapons to our arsenal, including personalised gene therapy, artificial intelligence screening, simple blood tests and potentially soon vaccines.\nCancer accounted for nearly 10 million deaths almost one in six of the global total in 2020, according to the World Health Organization.\nAhead of World Cancer Day on Saturday, here are some of the promising recent developments in diagnosing and treating the disease.\nImmunotherapy drugs, which stimulate the immune system to track down and kill cancerous cells, have been one the biggest advances in cancer treatment over the last decade.\nWith fewer severe side effects than chemotherapy, immunotherapy has had a profound effect on the treatment of several types of cancer.\nBefore 2010, the survival rate for people with severe cases of the skin cancer melanoma was very low. But thanks to immunotherapy drugs, some patients can now live for 10 years or more.\nHowever not all tumours respond to immunotherapy, which has its own side effects.\n\"We are only at the beginning of immunotherapy,\" said Bruno Quesnel, research director at France's National Cancer Institute.\nPierre Saintigny, an oncologist at France's Leon Berard cancer centre, said that different kinds of immunotherapy treatments will need to be combined \"as intelligently as possible.\"\n\"With immunotherapy, we have moved up a level in cancer treatment, but steps still need to be taken for all the patients who do not benefit from it,\" he added.\nCAR-T therapy involves taking the T-cells from the blood of an individual patient and modifying them in a laboratory.\nThen the T-cells, which are part of the immune system, are injected back into the patient, newly trained to target cancerous cells.\nAnother technique called Allogeneic CAR-T involves getting the cells from a different, healthy person.\nSo far, CAR-T therapies have mainly been effective against some kinds of leukaemia, and the process remains very expensive.\nComputer programmes using artificial intelligence (AI) have been shown to identify brain and breast cancer from routine scans with more accuracy than humans.\nWith AI research booming across a range of fields, it is expected to play an increasing role in other ways to diagnose cancer.\n\"Thanks to artificial intelligence, we will be able to identify which patients can benefit from shorter treatment,\" said Fabrice Andre, an oncologist France's Gustave Roussy cancer institute.\nThis would mean fewer side effects for patients, and a lower burden on the health system.\nLiquid biopsies are able to detect cancer in DNA from a simple blood test, which is easier and less invasive than traditional biopsies which require a tissue simple.\nQuicker and easier testing would help doctors detect and act against cancer before it has the chance to spread.\nThe new technique is now being used in the United States, \"but there are still a lot of false positives,\" Andre said.\nThere have long been vaccines available to protect against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, and hepatitis B which can lead to liver cancer.\nBut after decades of failed efforts towards a cancer vaccine, hopes have risen that the mRNA technology pioneered for Covid-19 vaccines could also lead to a breakthrough in cancer.\nVaccines that treat rather than prevent cancer have been the most promising in development.\nIn December, the drugmakers Moderna and Merck announced positive early trial results for their personalised mRNA vaccine to treat skin cancer patients.\nAnd last month, German pharmaceutical BioNTech said that 10,000 people in Britain would be part of a trial for a mRNA cancer vaccine that would be tailored to individual tumours.\nSteven Le Gouill, the head of the hospital group at France's Curie Institute, said he was optimistic for the future of cancer treatment.\nIdeally, we will \"combine all these approaches and new therapies to have a personalised plan for the patient,\" he said.\n\"We have passed a milestone in our understanding of the tumour cell,\" he said.\n\"Cancer remains an ordeal, but progress has been made exponentially.\"\nFollow and connect with us on Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin,",

      "body": "OpenAI, the maker of the popular generative language model ChatGPT and Dall-E, has announced a new tool which will help detect AI-written content. It can \"distinguish between text written by a human and text written by AIs from a variety of providers,\" says the company.  \"We've trained a classifier to distinguish between text written by a human and text written by AIs from a variety of providers,\" reads the press release. Also Read | ChatGPT is getting a paid version for those who dont want to wait to talk to AI chatbot Dubbed as Classifier, the new tool is easy to use. You should have an OpenAI account to use this tool. Simply paste the text and it will tell you if the text is very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated. The tool is publicly available. OpenAI has created Classifier using a dataset of pairs of human-written text and AI-written text on the same topic. The company collected this dataset from a variety of sources including human-written ones and the ones generated on prompts submitted to InstructGPT. \"We divided each text into a prompt and a response. On these prompts we generated responses from a variety of different language models trained by us and other organizations. For our web app, we adjust the confidence threshold to keep the false positive rate low; in other words, we only mark text as likely AI-written if the classifier is very confident.\" Also Read | ChatGPT to soon replace software engineers? OpenAI reportedly training AI to code at scale The maker of Classifier warns that the classifier is not fully reliable and that it should not be used as a \"primary decision-making tool\" to determine the source of the content. During the evaluation of Classifier, it found that the classifier correctly identified \"26% of AI-written text (true positives) as \"likely AI-written,\" while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives).\" The company says that the tool's reliability improves as the length of the input text increases. Classifier, as per the company, is unreliable for content under 1,000 characters. Sometimes, even the longer texts can be incorrectly labelled by the classifier. The tool comes with several other limitations like sometimes the human-written text can be labelled as AI-written or determining the source for predictable texts. For the unawares, ChatGPT is a chatbot created by OpenAI and sees investments from tech giant Microsoft. It is an AI-based chatbot that is trained to conduct human-like conversations over complex and all kinds of topics. Also Read | ChatGPT can destroy Google in two years, says Gmail creator",

OpenAI cautioned that its tool can make mistakes, particularly with texts containing fewer than 1,000 characters.\nWhile it is impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text, we believe good classifiers can inform mitigations for false claims that AI-generated text was written by a human, OpenAI said in the post.\nFor example, runningautomated misinformation campaigns, using AI tools for academic dishonesty, and positioning an AI chatbot as ahuman.\nA top French university last week forbade students from using ChatGPT to complete assignments, in the first such ban at a college in the country.\nThe decision came shortly after word that OpenAI ChatGPT had passed exams at a US law school after writing essays on topics ranging from constitutional law to taxation. ChatGPT still makes factual mistakes, but education facilities have rushed to ban the AI tool.\nWe recognize that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognizing the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom, OpenAI said in the post.\nWe are engaging with educators in the US to learn what they are seeing in their classrooms and to discuss ChatGPTs capabilities and limitations.\nOfficials in New York and other jurisdictions have forbidden its use in schools. A group of Australian universities have said they would change exam formats to banish AI tools and regard them as cheating.\nOpenAI said it recommends using the classifier only with English text as it performs worse in other languages.\nHero and Featured Images: Courtesy Photography Lionel BONAVENTURE/AFP\nThis story is published via AFP Relaxnews.\nMicrosoft                        ChatGPT                        OpenAI\nLifestyle Asia\nTechnology\nSign up for our newsletters to have the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox every week.\nYes, I agree to the",

A report from The Verge reveals that the search engine giant is holding an event on how its using the power of AI to reimagine how people search for, explore and interact with information, making it more natural and intuitive than ever before to find what you need. Even from this short description alone, its easy to deduce that Google here is likely referring to plans to include a ChatGPT-like chatbot in its search engine. Company CEO Sundar Pichai just announced in a conference call that Google will make AI-based Large Language Models like LaMDA available for testing in the coming weeks and months. These LLMs could be used as a companion to search, he added. The conference call was held following the companys fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. Google has enjoyed a mammoth share of the search engine market for well over a decade now, with no other search engine coming close to it in terms of popularity. Second to it is Bing, with a share of less than 3.5%. But the recent breakthroughs made with AI chatbots have got the company rattled  it even declared a code red fearing a disruption in its search business. Where a Google search only yields a list of website links, ChatGPT goes the extra mile in answering your queries in clear, simple sentences that are much easier to understand. Add to that the ability to generate content from scratch. Microsoft is already planning to integrate ChatGPT into Bing, which could allow it to provide more intelligent summaries and results, thereby threatening Google's dominance. The 40-minute event will be streamed on YouTube on February 8 at 7:00pm.",

Reuters\nChatGPT, a popular\nchatbot\nfrom OpenAI, is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to a UBS study on Wednesday.\nThe report, citing data from analytics firm Similarweb, said an average of about 13 million unique visitors had used\nChatGPT\nper day in January, more than double the levels of December.\n\"In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,\" UBS analysts wrote in the note.\nIt took TikTok about nine months after its global launch to reach 100 million users and Instagram 2-1/2 years, according to data from Sensor Tower.\nChatGPT can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp, made it available to the public for free in late November.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said.\nAnalysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give\na first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while imposing substantial computing costs on OpenAI, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses.\nThe company said the subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost.\nThe availability of the tool has raised questions about the facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation.\nLast month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI in the form of cash and the provision of cloud computing.",

But Israelis researchers from the software development company CyberArk also found recently that with a little bit of authoritative persistence you can convince ChatGPT to create malware, which it is not supposed to be able to do. Participants in Cybertech Tel Aviv 2023 view company exhibits on Jan. 31, 2023 (credit: MAYA MARGIT/THE MEDIA LINE)&ldquo;The findings were very interesting,&rdquo; Ori Goldberg, head of CyberArk Labs, the research arm of CyberArk, told The Media Line. The researchers &ldquo;managed to get ChatGPT to create malicious code, but also they found a way to hide that malicious code from your standard antivirus systems in a way that is quite original.&rdquo;&ldquo;For every new technology, it takes time for it to get wrapped with the proper security measures,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We see that all the time.&rdquo;Increased threats to cybersecurityAccording to the World Economic Forum, cyberattacks increased by 38% across the globe in 2022 and could rise exponentially over the coming year due to generative AI models.One of the primary challenges for cybersecurity is that the attackers seem to be one step ahead.&ldquo;AI-based attacks are going to be much more pervasive, much more adaptable and much more rapid than they were in the past and human defenders just can&rsquo;t keep up with the pace,&rdquo; said Hudi Zack, a cyber industry expert who previously headed the technology division of the Israel National Cyber Directorate.&nbsp;&ldquo;Until a human defender will be able to figure out what&rsquo;s going on, find the right countermeasures and react, the AI attack will have already reached its destination,&rdquo; he told The Media Line. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to fight fire with fire and assign the defense task to an AI-based system.&rdquo;Others in the sector agreed that, in the near future, a machine will have to battle a machine.&ldquo;AI is already changing cybersecurity in terms of attackers that can already generate malware and also defenders that can use AI to predict and understand when attacks happen,&rdquo; Eden Zaraf, CTO and co-founder of cyber firm Kayran, told The Media Line.Kayran has a web application that helps businesses scan their online assets and provides full reports of the vulnerabilities uncovered.&ldquo;I think that the defenders should think like attackers,&rdquo; Zaraf said. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re using AI then I will need to use AI.&rdquo;Some companies already are relying on AI for defense purposes, like the information security company Cognni.The Tel Aviv-based startup has an AI-based solution that autonomously maps, detects and then investigates exposures in companies&rsquo; critical information assets.&ldquo;Our AI knows how to autonomously classify information, saving months and sometimes years of work for an organization,&rdquo; Guy Eisdorfer, co-founder and CEO at Cognni, told The Media Line.Although Eisdorfer acknowledges that generative AI poses a unique challenge for cybersecurity firms, he also thinks that ultimately it is good for business.&ldquo;At the end of the day it&rsquo;s generating jobs for a company like us to reinvent the way we protect information and give solutions to solve it,&rdquo; he said.As cybercrime takes a massive leap forward and security experts play catch-up, AI will be able to create much more sophisticated phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks thanks to deepfakes, voice cloning capabilities or worse, according to Zack.He recommended that businesses strengthen passwords, fix any vulnerable code, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; educate people about the risks of AI-led campaigns.&ldquo;Obviously AI is already embedded in some defense systems today, but for it to really independently and autonomously manage the defense campaign against an AI-based attack it will require a whole new set of capabilities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think this is the biggest challenge right now.&rdquo;Sign up for the Business & Innovation Newsletter >>",

AI bot can easily crack Google's entry-level job interviews and exams\nWhile testing out ChatGPTs abilities against its own upcoming AI chatbot, Google found out that OpenAIs chatbot can easily clear all exams and interviews to be hired as an L3 engineer at Google.\nMehul Reuben Das\nFebruary 03, 2023 10:51:57 IST\nWhile testing out ChatGPTs abilities against its own upcoming AI chatbot, Google found out that OpenAIs chatbot can easily clear all exams and interviews to be hired as an L3 engineer at Google.\nAt Google, alarm bells are ringing all over thanks to ChatGPT. So worried is the tech giant that not only has it had to issue a code red warning over ChatGPT, and has had to pull its socks up to counter the threat that OpenAIs chatbot poses, they have also had to ask the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin to return and help them manage the business, till they find a solution that can take on ChatGPT.\nA report of a new experiment, however, only seems to exacerbate Googles problem. Apparently, according to an assessment carried out by Google, ChatGPT is so efficient and skilled that it may easily land an entry-level coding job at Google. ChatGPT hypothetically landed an L3 role at Google, which is the grade given to an entry-level software engineer.\nGoogle has been testing their own AI-based software solutions and chatbot tool, called Apprentice Bard, and tested out just how efficient ChatGPT can be. It was during these tests that they found out that ChatGPT could actually ace interviews and exams that Google conducts while hiring entry-level employees. Googles hiring interviews and exams are considered to be one of the toughest exams to crack for a non-government job, across the world.\nAccording to CNBC, Google has been developing a beta chatbot built on Googles conversation technology LaMDA. Google compared ChatGPT and LaMDA replies in different papers. Amazingly, ChatGPT is recruited at L3 when interviewed for a coding position, according to an internal document comparing ChatGPT to LaMDA.\nWhen Google engineers questioned LaMDA chat and ChatGPT if they will replace programmers in the future during the test, both chatbots disagreed. No, ChatGPT and AlphaCode will not replace programmers, LaMDA said. Googles chatbot response was also accompanied by four paragraphs of explanation, including that programming is a team sport and that while chatbots can help programmers work more efficiently, they cannot replace the creativity and artistry that is required for a great programme, according to the CNBC report.\nChatGPT had similar sentiments regarding the future of programming. It is unlikely that ChatGPT or Alphacode will replace programmers because they are incapable of fully replacing human programmers expertise and creativityprogramming is a complex field that requires a deep understanding of computer science principles and the ability to adapt to new technologies, ChatGPT stated in an internal document obtained by CNBC.\nChatGPTs intelligence cannot be questioned because the chatbot has also",

The tweet from Netflix Japan comes off as a little tone-deaf as a result, as the issue isnt necessarily the labor shortage itself, as it is the subpar working conditions in general.\nIronically, the credits also list the background designer as AI + Human, implying that human artists were involved in creating the art for the film, but the credits dont seem to reflect that appropriately. Needless to say, Netflix has been met with tons of flak in the tweet replies, as fans and viewers alike are calling for better working conditions for animators and artists instead of relying on AI for image generation.\nRelated Posts",

(KDVR)  STEM School Highlands Ranch is taking a new step toward school safety.\nDouglas County commissioners voted to approve a $961,504 grant for a project to install technology called Evolv this spring.\nSuspects wanted for breaking into at least 20 cars in Lone Tree\nIts a new version of a metal detector that uses artificial intelligence and supposedly can detect the presence of a weapon without picking up on personal items like cell phones or keys.\nThis is the same school where a shooter killed Kendrick Castillo and injured at least seven others back in 2019.\nAI weapon detector set for soft launch\nNicole Bostel, STEM Schools director of communication, said Commissioner Abe Layden approached them with the idea.\n(He) said that they had funding available for an innovative approach to a security system inside of a school, Bostel said.\nThe district has done its homework on beefing up security, visiting facilities that use this technology and also speaking with a school district in North Carolina that uses it.\nColorado gas prices rising higher than other states\nThe 2-1 vote had opposition from Commissioner Lora Thomas, who showed concern about the technologys effectiveness. But Bostel said thats why theyre doing a soft launch.\nWe know its not a perfect system and thats the reason why were doing a pilot program, Bostel said. Were not locked into anything. If, after the pilot program runs out, if it doesnt work for us, we can go in a different direction.\nTo start, they will have only one system installed at the schools athletics entrance.\nThe goal is to then get two more systems to have them in place at our two main entrances for the fall. So, we want to use a portion of the remainder of the school year to kind of test it out, Bostel said.\nCommittee to assess Evolv system\nThey also have an Evolv executive committee in place to access how the system works in the school. It has students, parents and staff alike.\nSafety at STEM is a topic still on many parents and students minds after the 2019 shooting, and its one reason theyre taking that extra step.\nRestaurant gets complaints of mystery charges from around the US\nWe know its not perfect, but we know its an innovative approach and has worked in other facilities. Could we be the school that helps make it the next thing for school safety? I think its a viable option, Bostel said.\nTheyre still waiting to receive their first Evolv system but do expect it to be installed within the next month or two.\nClose Modal",

Two Seinfeld fans have combined several of these tools together to create \"Nothing, Forever,\" a parody of the hit sitcom that is created entirely by AI, and never stops broadcasting on Twitch. The videos feature four characters that look like 3D renders of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer, all conversing in Jerry's apartment like in the show, but largely speaking in bizarre dialogue. Interstitials like the TV series also occur, with exterior shots of the building and even the Jerry character performing stand-up, laugh track included.\n\"The actual impetus for this was it originally started its life as this weird, very, off-center kind of nonsensical, surreal art project,\" co-creator Skyler Hartle told Vice's Motherboard about the project . \"But then we kind of worked over the years to bring it to this new place. And then, of course, generative media and generative AI just kind of took off in a crazy way over the past couple of years.\"\nThe Nothing, Forever \"show\" generates its dialogue using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, combing with machine learning, generative algorithms, and cloud services. The creators also confirmed that \"dialogue, speech, direction (camera cuts, character focus, shot length, scene length, etc), character movement, and music\" are all decided by the AI.As the creators put it, in theory, \"Nothing, Forever\" being a non-stop version of Seinfeld could potentially pave the way for \"nonstop\" versions of your favorite shows in the future.",

The joint work will apply AI foundation model technology to NASA's Earth-observing satellite data for the first time, NASA said in a statement.    Foundation models are types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabelled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another.    \"The beauty of foundation models is they can potentially be used for many downstream applications,\" said Rahul Ramachandran, a senior research scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.  \"Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams; you need teams across different organisations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets,\" Ramachandran said in a statement.  One project will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites, the statement said.  By analysing satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields, and wildlife habitats, this model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planet's environmental systems.  Another output from this collaboration is expected to be an easily searchable corpus of Earth science literature.  IBM has developed a natural language processing (NLP) model trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organise the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge, the company said.  Beyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science could be infused into NASA's scientific data management and stewardship processes.  s",

It would finish its job much quicker.\nUsing The Correct Amount Of Moving Parts\nIf managers at\nDynamixsolutions.com\nwant to streamline their business, theyll need to calculate how many employees should focus on one particular client. If its either too little or too many, it will cause problems.\nIts the same when developing products with multiple parts. For example, if building a tunnel under the sea, youll need to know how many sections it should be. Too many increases costs, and too few cause disasters.\nSpend Time Doing Lots Of Market Research\nYou need to know what customers want before manufacturing anything, which means doing lots of product research. Its okay to do everything yourself, but its easier to let artificial intelligence do it for you.\nIt could keep track of reviews on websites like Amazon and Walmart, so you know what grievances customers have with similar products. Information like this helps companies create products people want.\nChoosing Materials From The Right Place\nJewelry makers earn most of their money by finding great deals when buying materials. It makes sense because precious metals cost more than anything else. AI could keep an eye on prices and tell you when to purchase certain things.\nIt could also tell you where the cheapest places to buy them are because it will keep track of multiple sites.

      "body": "0\nIn the unstoppable world of technology, nothing has made as much noise in recent days as ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool. He put Metaverse in his pocket. Deservedly. Because it is something that is already within everyones reach. With simple commands, you can build any type of text with characteristics close to those made by a human being  journalistic, legal, medical articles, poems, song lyrics, cake recipes, jokes, academic theses, mathematical problems and even language. schedule. All in seconds. Are there imperfections? Yes. And many! But it is worth remembering that it is in Beta phase, released to the public on a website opened just 60 days ago. The success made Microsoft put another US$ 10 billion (officially unconfirmed) in OpenAI, the company that owns ChatGPT. The announcement of the new contribution was made on Monday (23).\nThe giant founded by Bill Gates was already a partner in the operation (with two previous rounds, of US$ 1 billion and US$ 2 billion). It leveraged participation. We have a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. OpenAI was created in 2015 by a small group that included Samuel Altman (entrepreneur behind the Y Combinator accelerator and today the companys CEO), the ubiquitous Elon Musk and the Russian programmer Ilya Sutskever (OpenAIs chief scientist). It was born non-profit, but in 2018, after Musk left, it shifted its focus to generating revenue. Thats where Microsoft comes close. Officially, OpenAI also names Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, as investors.\nMacron denies agreement with ex-president Sarkozy in exchange for backing his campaign\nTools like ChatGPT have the potential to transform the office world the way the first generations of technology influenced the factory floor. On Monday (23), Bill Gates told The Australian Financial Review that AI still has no effect on the job market. But it will, he said. There will be a lot of angst for the white collar because the AI targets him. Even Google is expected to be severely impacted.\nCONTROVERSIES ChatGPT is disruptive as the word has rarely been used. This is because it has implications not only for the labor market, but also for ethical and legal questions related to authorship, accuracy and bias. Like a hammer  its used to build a house or kill a person  technology can be a propagator of misinformation, or minor crimes like doing schoolwork. Thats why OpenAI is already working to have a kind of seal that identifies texts produced on the platform. The road to controversy, however, is already paved. And he is well known for OpenAI, the company behind Dall-E, which creates images of all kinds from simple text commands and has generated controversy in 2022 in the art world.",

      "body": "With over 18 years of experience in digital entertainment, Butler is known to have pioneered the use of AI technology within the entertainment and media landscape.\nBy                  Entrepreneur Middle East Staff                                    Feb 3, 2023.\nShare.\nYou're reading Entrepreneur Middle East, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\nIf you're keen on keeping up with all things tech, then it is highly likely that the Saudi Arabia-located global annual technology conference LEAP has been on your radar.\nLEAP's newest edition is set to run from February 6-9, 2023, at the Riyadh Front Expo Centre, and this year, the event will have a special focus on artificial intelligence (AI) with the inaugural installment of DeepFest, which is expected to bring together leading AI companies from all over the world.\nBesides throwing the spotlight on AI-driven initiatives by governments as well as the latest innovations within this space, DeepFest has been designed as a thought leadership conference that also includes a series of sector-dedicated tracks, trainings, live-demos, and innovation sessions.\nAnd among the many experts set to participate in DeepFest is Ricky Ray Butler, CEO of California-based influencer marketing and product placement agency BENlabs. Butler will be one of three speakers at a 50-minute-long panel set to happen on February 8, 2023.\nWith over 18 years of experience in digital entertainment, Butler is known to have pioneered the use of AI technology within the entertainment and media landscape. Having unlocked how to better create digital brands and content by making use of AI, BENLabs is today empowering 13 million influencers, creators, and brands to leverage data driven systems and processes to grow their audiences and revenues.\n\"A close mentor taught me early in my career to think around the corner to the problems of tomorrow,\" Butler said, in an interview with Entrepreneur Middle East. \"If you are solving the problems of today, you are already way behind. BENlabs is laser-focused on applying AI to solve the problems of tomorrow.\".\nAccording to Butler, up to this point, the advancements in AI have been used and viewed as a productivity tool in fields like manufacturing, supply chain, and automotive- AI has, so far, been used as a way to eliminate time spent doing manual tasks, and BENlabs wishes to expand that application of AI technology into the realm of creativity.\nRelated: Straight From The Source: Entrepreneurs, Here's How Investors At LEAP 2023 Suggest You Should Pitch To Them.\n\"We believe that in many cases -like with ChatGPT- AI can be just as creative as the human mind, which is a cultural mindset shift,\" Butler noted. \"Digital creators of all types will use AI technology to expand their ability to help create more and better content, which will in turn help creators scale their content in this decentralized world of content and platforms. Brands and creators will be able to be more focused on what they do best- developing creative strategy (and translating that creative into a reality much faster), rather than spending time on tedious tasks.\".\nIt's no secret that there are multiple sectors across the globe that have benefitted from the undeniable impact of AI technology. In fact, as per a January 2023 analysis by ReportLinker, the global AI market is expected to grow by US$125.3 billion by 2027. Closer to home, Saudi Arabia has been continually supporting AI-driven business ideas to drive forth its economy, with Mordor Intelligence reporting that the country's big data and AI market is expected to reach $891.74 million by 2026.\n\"We are huge supporters of the investment the Saudi Arabian region is making into AI and its transformational power,\" Butler said. \"I am looking forward to hearing from the AI thought leaders in the region, who we view as the best in the world. We want to bring our expertise in applying AI to media and entertainment into this region, and contribute to the ecosystem of likeminded AI enthusiasts.\".\nAs Butler now gets set for his appearance at DeepFest in Riyadh, he urges AI enthusiasts to keep in mind that while AI offers unlimited opportunities, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to optimize the technology.\n\"My advice with AI applications is to crawl first, walk second and then run,\" Butler said. \"AI should be thought of as an extension of a human brain- where AI and human experts can collaboratively work together to drive scale and efficiency. There are still large barriers to entry and resource constraints around adopting AI, however I would recommend that business leaders find low hanging fruit where AI can prove successful and then look how they can apply to more and more complex issues.\".\nRicky Ray Butler is one of the many speakers making an appearance at DeepFest, the premier meeting place for the global artificial intelligence ecosystem of thought leaders, changemakers, big tech, data scientists, innovators, enterprises, academia, startups, and entrepreneurs leading innovation across businesses.

      "body": "February 2, 2023 10:19 pm\nBy Herb Greenberg,\nEmpire Financial Research\nWell, that didnt take long\nIt has been a mere two months since chatbot ChatGPT came out of nowhere to be everywhere and the stock promoters are up to their old tricks.\nThe Dash for Trash, as it has been called, is off to the races  this time with artificial intelligence (AI) as the new hook.\nThats not to say the other garbage hasnt been flying as well\nThe poster child for that might be Carvana (CVNA), which has doubled in the span of a few weeks even though its end market is getting blasted and its business model is running on fumes. (I keep wondering, whatll ever happen to those silly vending machines that Carvana built around the country for car deliveries Will they be repurposed into multistory trampoline parks? But I digress)\nBut its the AI ties that snared my attention\nTake SoundHound AI (SOUN), for example. Its a member of the 2022 class of broken special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). After wallowing at around $1 per share earlier this month, SoundHounds stock has roughly doubled on news about its voice-activated AI software after announcing additional financing, strong preliminary 2022 results, and a deal for a customer engagement platform to use its software.\nAnd remember BuzzFeed (BZFD), another busted SPAC? Its stock also doubled to around $2 per share after the company announced it will be using ChatGPT to create quizzes and other content.\nThats not to say either of these companies wont go on to achieve greatness, because winners will certainly emerge among the broken SPACS\nBut its a stretch, and such big rises on such meager AI news is a clue to beware of the hype  more of which is surely to come.\nAs far back as November, well before anybody had heard of ChatGPT, Forbes said just that\nAI will be one of the next boom bubble busts and its starting to kick off now.\nAnd just a few weeks ago, with ChatGPT front and center, TechCrunch wrote a story headlined, Whoops! Is generative AI already becoming a bubble?\nThe obvious comparison, the story noted, is cryptocurrencies\nMiller described the situation as similar to what happened with [non-fungible tokens] and blockchain. The techs allure prompted investors  looking to make sure they didnt miss the trend  to pour money into numerous companies regardless of having any real use cases.\nHe isnt the only one to make that connection either. Several other investors said the techs growth has reminded them too much of crypto: Everyone is piling on faster than they should be.\nTyler Griffin, a managing partner at Restive Ventures, drew parallels with how blockchain was treated when the hype was building. It has echoes of the early days of crypto: Genuine excitement about a new, fascinating technology, coupled with outrageous predictions of transformative applications that betray a lack of understanding by (often non-technical) people about whats really going on, he said.\nIts also very reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The TechCrunch story quoted one venture capitalist who added\nIt can be both true that enormous companies will eventually be built in the space and that aggregate returns on capital for the industry will prove dreadful.\nThere is no question that AI, which has been evolving for years, will be huge and so will the hype and frenzy surrounding it.\nBuyers beware.\nSponsored: Find a Qualified Financial Advisor\nFinding a qualified financial advisor doesnt have to be hard.

More than half of respondents to a JPMorgan Chase survey of 835 institutional and professional traders said such technology would have the most influence on trading in the next three years. Thats up from a quarter last year. This trend toward automation is something were seeing across the market now and is expanding into the credit and rates side as well as commodities, said Scott Wacker, head of FICC e-commerce sales at JPMorgan. Quantitative hedge funds are bringing systematic models optimised with machine learning to over-the-counter markets, he said. Were also seeing asset managers using data in a more dynamic way using AI-enhanced technologies to assess and improve how theyre executing trades.  Many asset managers already try to integrate some form of AI into their systems and algorithms, according to Bloomberg Intelligences 2022 US Institutional Equity Trading study. Still, the majority regarded AI as more of a catchword emerging technology. The release of ChatGPT in November has turbocharged broader interest in AI technology and natural language processing. The tool has lit up the internet and sparked fresh debate over the role of AI across workplaces. People are amazed at what AI technology can achieve, said Mr Wacker. Natural language processing is moving along at pace but its a little harder to configure right now. Its at the beginning of a journey. Elsewhere in JPMorgans survey, there were signs the past years turmoil in the cryptocurrency industry had curtailed enthusiasm toward the asset class.  Seventy-two per cent of traders say they have no plans to trade crypto, up from about a quarter last year. Separately, blockchain and distributed ledger technology was seen as having the third-largest impact on trading after AI and application programming interface integration, which allows apps to work with each other. JPMorgan is using blockchain in repurchase agreement markets. Blockchain in terms of settling and managing trades is going to be very interesting, said Mr Wacker. Its a little further down the line. But in the same way that AI and machine learning werent quite there a couple years ago, blockchain technology is poised to move up the ladder. Traders predicted that \"recession risk\" would have the biggest impact on markets this year, closely followed by inflation. And in a change to the survey response for the past six years, \"liquidity availability\" was no longer the leading daily trading challenge. Instead, 46 per cent of traders predict \"volatile markets\" will be their greatest daily trading challenge this year. That is testament to how well the market has functioned over the past 12 months that liquidity concerns have reduced so drastically, Mr Wacker said. In spite of the elevated volatility and activity, the markets have proven robust and reliable.",

      "body": "ChatGPT scours text across the internet to generate informed responses\nbut has been shown to provide different answers to the same question. It also fabricates information on occasion to make inventive and compelling lies.\nThe nascent platform has caused alarm in recent weeks, including in schools, where teachers fear OpenAIs platform could be used by students for plagiarism.\nPadilla defended his use of the technology, suggesting it could make Colombias bloated legal system more efficient. The judge also used precedent from previous rulings to support his decision.\nPadilla told Blu Radio on Tuesday that ChatGPT and other such programs could be useful to facilitate the drafting of texts but not with the aim of replacing judges.\nPadilla also insisted that by asking questions to the application, we do not stop being judges, thinking beings.\nThe judge argued that ChatGPT performs services previously provided by a secretary and did so in an organised, simple and structured manner that could improve response times in the justice system.\nProf Juan David Gutierrez of Rosario University was among those to express incredulity at the judges admission.\nHe called for urgent digital literacy training for judges.\nColombia approved a law in 2022 that suggests that public lawyers should use technologies where possible to make their work more efficient.\nOctavio Tejeiro, a judge in Colombias supreme court, said AI caused moral panic in law as people feared robots would replace judges, but he predicted the tool would probably soon become accepted and commonplace.\nThe justice system should make the most of technology as a tool but always while following ethics and taking into account that the administrator of justice is ultimately a human being, Tejeiro said. It must be seen as an instrument that serves the judge to improve his judgment. We cannot allow the tool to become more important than the person.\nTejeiro told the Guardian he had not used ChatGPT but would consider using it in future.\nThe chatbot itself was more apprehensive about its new role in the justice system.\nJudges should not use ChatGPT when ruling on legal cases  It is not a substitute for the knowledge, expertise and judgment of a human judge, it responded to a question from the Guardian.\nJournalists should exercise caution when using quotes generated by ChatGPT in their articles, the bot added.\nTopics",

      "body": "Feb 2, 2023 8:34 PM CST\n1 minute & 17 seconds read time\nA show called 'Nothing, Forever' runs 24/7 on Twitch using OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate endless episodes of the hit sitcom Seinfeld. Visually it looks like an early 3D game that might have appeared on the original PlayStation or a 3dfx Voodoo PC from the 1990s.\n4\nVIEW GALLERY - 4 IMAGES\nAnd with the AI-generated jokes and dialogue being of the \"very weird\" and \"strange\" type, the stilted animation gives the whole thing a dreamlike quality. This is probably why thousands are tuning in to watch.\nIf you're a fan of Seinfeld, you'll no doubt be familiar with Jerry's apartment as the backdrop for many interactions, not to mention the crude renditions of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer. Except here, Jerry is called Larry, in a nod to Seinfeld's co-creator Larry David. There are even stand-up comedy interludes ala the show, but these sound more like bizarre stream-of-consciousness observations than actually funny jokes.\nHere's the official description.\nNothing, Forever is a show about nothing, that happens forever. Kinda like popular sitcoms of the past, except that it never stops.\nNothing, Forever is always-on, runs 365 days of the year, and delivers new content every minute.\nEverything you see, hear, or experience (with the exception of the artwork and laugh track) is always brand new content, generated via machine learning and AI algorithms.\nMany conversations between characters are inane, talking about everyday things in a dry way reminiscent of Seinfeld's 'Show About Nothing' structure, except without the comedic element that has made it one of the most popular and well-known comedies. One example included Jerry and Elaine talking about vegan cheesesteaks with a laugh track, except it wasn't funny. The fun comes from reading the chat and seeing people's responses to AI-generated episodes of Seinfeld.\n* Prices last scanned on 2/2/2023 at 8:14 pm CST - prices may not be accurate, click links above for the latest price.

Ultimately, it could facilitate a larger number of people working on some of our most pressing climate issues,\" Raghu Ganti, principal researcher at IBM, said in a statement.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, these models have rapidly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) technology, and IBM is pioneering applications of foundation models beyond language, said the company.\r\n\r\n\"Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams,\" Rahul Ramachandran, senior research scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, said in a statement.\r\n\r\n\"You need teams across different organisations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets,\" he added.\r\n\r\nMoreover, IBM and NASA plan to develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations.\r\n\r\nThe first model will be trained on over 3,00,000 earth science publications in order to thematically organise the literature and make it easier to search for and discover new knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe second model will be trained using the popular Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS2) satellite dataset from the USGS and NASA, with applications ranging from detecting natural hazards to tracking changes in vegetation and wildlife habitats, the company mentioned.\r\n\r\nFurther, other potential IBM-NASA collaborative projects in this agreement include developing a foundation model for weather and climate prediction using MERRA-2, an atmospheric observation dataset.",
