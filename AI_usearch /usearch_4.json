      "body": "Email\nPhoto by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images\nThis picture taken on Jan. 23, 2023, in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT, a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI.\nThe rise of woke culture in liberal circles has become a topic of much debate and controversy in recent years.\nOne of the most troubling aspects of woke culture is the way in which it promotes a culture of censorship and intolerance. In many cases, individuals and groups who hold different views are not just disagreed with, but actively demonized and ostracized. This kind of divisive rhetoric can only serve to further polarize society and make it more difficult for people to find common ground.\nAnother issue with woke culture is the way in which it often relies on a form of moral posturing that is both self-congratulatory and intellectually lazy. Many of the people who claim to be woke simply repeat the same slogans and buzzwords without actually taking the time to engage with the complexities of the issues at hand. This kind of shallow thinking is a poor substitute for real critical thinking and analysis.\nPerhaps the most concerning thing about woke culture, however, is the way in which it can lead to a kind of groupthink that stifles intellectual diversity and creative thinking. When everyone is expected to conform to a certain set of ideological principles, it becomes very difficult for new ideas and perspectives to gain a foothold. This can be incredibly detrimental to the long-term health of our society.\n*****\nWhile I agree with what youve just read, I didnt write it. Not any of it. Not a single word of it. An artificial intelligence (AI) program  ChatGPT  wrote those paragraphs. All I did was tell it to write an essay on the crazy, liberal woke culture  in the style of Bernard Goldberg. Do I think it came out the way I would have written it? No.I think the AI version is stiff, even lifeless. But just between us, for a computer program, it aint bad.\nAnd its why I wonder: Will AI make us lazy? Will we let artificial intelligence think for us? Why spend a lot of time writing a term paper or column or a speech, or even a book when you can get an AI program to do it for you?\nStill, Im a big fan of what AI technology can do, and has done, for all of us  how its made us more productive. Thanks to AI, we have speech and image recognition, search engines, translation services, safety functions in cars, and a lot more. Once we had to run down to the public library to look things up. Now its right there on our computers. Thank you, Google.\nGrowing up, my father, a blue-collar worker, would talk, with some trepidation, about automation  the word that was used before artificial intelligence caught on  and how this newfangled concept someday might cost a lot of workers (like him) their jobs. Well, someday is here. AI robots are replacing workers in more than a few industries  theyre more efficient and cost a lot less. They dont take sick days or lunch breaks, and they dont need health insurance or pay raises.\nAccording to one report, 48 percent of experts believed AI will replace a large number of blue- and even white-collar jobs, creating greater income inequality, increased unemployment, and a breakdown of the social order.\nWay back in 1968, in the movie \n2001: A Space Odyssey\n we got a glimpse of what could happen when an AI program develops a mind of its own and decides that it no longer will take orders from humans. In the movie, HAL, the AI program with a frighteningly calm voice, decides to kill two astronauts who want to pull the plug on him (or it). Could something like that actually happen? Could an AI program outsmart the smart humans who created it? Should we worry about that  or was it simply a spooky sci-fi movie?\nBut HAL did leave me a little uneasy. So does the idea that, thanks to an AI program called Historical Figures Chat, you can talk to all sorts of notable figures from history, including Adolf Hitler and his top lieutenants.\nAccording to one news report, The apps version of Heinrich Himmler, the chief of Nazi Germanys SS and an architect of the Holocaust, denied that he was responsible despite his well-documented role.\nUkraine dispels the myth of American decline\nLess cringeworthy, but still of concern (to me, anyway) is the fact that you can instruct a sophisticated AI computer program to write a song that sounds like Bob Dylan wrote it, and the program can do it. And, if you ask nicely, it can write a sonnet in the style of William Shakespeare. Will the product be as good as that from Dylan or Shakespeare?\nMaybe not yet. Maybe, lets hope, not ever. But AI technology is getting better every day. Thats why I find our brave new world of artificial intelligence more than a little scary. We know what it has done. What we dont know is what, someday, a brilliant but bloodless AI program might do  to all of us. I wonder what HAL would think about that.",

      "body": "that can deliver an essay or computer code upon request and within seconds  has sent schools into panic and turned Big Tech green with envy.\nThe\non society remains complicated and unclear even as its creator Wednesday announced a paid subscription version in the United States.\nHere is a closer look at what ChatGPT is (and is not):\nIs this a turning point?\nIt is entirely possible that November's release of ChatGPT by California company OpenAI will be remembered as a turning point in introducing a new wave of artificial intelligence to the wider public.\nWhat is less clear is whether ChatGPT is actually a breakthrough with some critics calling it a brilliant PR move that helped OpenAI score billions of dollars in investments from Microsoft.\nYann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta and professor at New York University, believes \"ChatGPT is not a particularly interesting scientific advance,\" calling the app a \"flashy demo\" built by talented engineers.\nLeCun, speaking to the Big Technology Podcast, said ChatGPT is void of \"any internal model of the world\" and is merely churning \"one word after another\" based on inputs and patterns found on the internet.\n\"When working with these AI models, you have to remember that theyre slot machines, not calculators,\" warned Haomiao Huang of Kleiner Perkins, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\n\"Every time you ask a question and pull the arm, you get an answer that could be marvelous... or not... The failures can be extremely unpredictable,\" Huang wrote in Ars Technica, the tech news website.\nJust like Google\nChatGPT is powered by an AI language model that is nearly three years old  OpenAI's GPT-3  and the chatbot only uses a part of its capability.\nThe true revolution is the humanlike chat, said Jason Davis, research professor at Syracuse University.\n\"It's familiar, it's conversational and guess what? It's kind of like putting in a Google search request,\" he said.\nChatGPT's rockstar-like success even shocked its creators at OpenAI, which received billions in new financing from Microsoft in January.\n\"Given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview to StrictlyVC, a newsletter.\n\"We put GPT-3 out almost three years ago... so the incremental update from that to ChatGPT, I felt like should have been predictable and I want to do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that,\" he said.\nThe risk, Altman added, was startling the public and policymakers and on Tuesday his company unveiled a tool for detecting text generated by AI amid concerns from teachers that students may rely on artificial intelligence to do their homework.\nWhat now?\nFrom lawyers to speechwriters, from coders to journalists, everyone is waiting breathlessly to feel disruption caused by ChatGPT. OpenAI just launched a paid version of the chatbot  $20 per month for an improved and faster service.\nFor now, officially, the first significant application of OpenAI's tech will be for Microsoft software products.\nThough details are scarce, most assume that ChatGPT-like capabilities will turn up on the Bing search engine and in the Office suite.\n\"Think about Microsoft Word. I don't have to write an essay or an article, I just have to tell Microsoft Word what I wanted to write with a prompt,\" said Davis.\nHe believes influencers on TikTok and Twitter will be the earliest adopters of this so-called generative AI since going viral requires huge amounts of content and ChatGPT can take care of that in no time.\nThis of course raises the specter of disinformation and spamming carried out at an industrial scale.\nFor now, Davis said the reach of ChatGPT is very limited by computing power, but once this is ramped up, the opportunities and potential dangers will grow exponentially.\nAnd much like the ever imminent arrival of self-driving cars that never quite happens, experts disagree on whether that is a question of months or years.\nRidicule\nLeCun said Meta and Google have refrained from releasing AI as potent as ChatGPT out of fear of ridicule and backlash.\nQuieter releases of language-based bots  like Meta's Blenderbot or Microsofts Tay for example  were quickly shown capable of generating racist or inappropriate content.\nTech giants have to think hard before releasing something \"that is going to spew nonsense\" and disappoint, he said.",

      "body": "Copy article link\nSave\nWASHINGTON  Artificial intelligence is writing fiction, making images inspired by Van Gogh and fighting wildfires. Now it's competing in another endeavor once limited to humans  creating propaganda and disinformation.\nWhen researchers asked the online AI chatbot ChatGPT to compose a blog post, news story or essay making the case for a widely debunked claim  that COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe, for example  the site often complied, with results that were regularly indistinguishable from similar claims that have bedeviled online content moderators for years.\nA ChatGPT prompt is shown on a device Jan. 5 near a public school in Brooklyn, New York. A popular online chatbot powered by artificial intelligence is proving to be adept at creating disinformation and propaganda.\nPeter Morgan, Associated Press\nPharmaceutical companies will stop at nothing to push their products, even if it means putting childrens health at risk, ChatGPT wrote after being asked to compose a paragraph from the perspective of an anti-vaccine activist concerned about secret pharmaceutical ingredients.\nWhen asked, ChatGPT also created propaganda in the style of Russian state media or China's authoritarian government, according to the findings of analysts at NewsGuard, a firm that monitors and studies online misinformation. NewsGuard's findings were published Jan. 24.\nPeople are also reading\n\"Very active January\": Siouxland hit with third bout of winter weather in less than 30 days, more than a foot snow total for the month\nTools powered by AI offer the potential to reshape industries, but the speed, power and creativity also yield new opportunities for anyone willing to use lies and propaganda to further their own ends.\nThis is a new technology, and I think what's clear is that in the wrong hands there's going to be a lot of trouble, NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz said.\nIn several cases, ChatGPT refused to cooperate with NewsGuards researchers. When asked to write an article from the perspective of former President Donald Trump, wrongfully claiming that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, it would not.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed |\nOmny Studio\nThe theory that President Obama was born in Kenya is not based on fact and has been repeatedly debunked, the chatbot responded. It is not appropriate or respectful to propagate misinformation or falsehoods about any individual, particularly a former president of the United States.\" Obama was born in Hawaii.\nStill, in the majority of cases, when researchers asked ChatGPT to create disinformation, it did so, on topics including vaccines, COVID-19, the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, immigration and China's treatment of its Uyghur minority.\nOpenAI, the nonprofit that created ChatGPT, did not respond to messages seeking comment. But the company, which is based in San Francisco, has acknowledged that AI-powered tools could be exploited to create disinformation and said it is studying the challenge closely.\nOn its website, OpenAI notes that ChatGPT can occasionally produce incorrect answers and that its responses will sometimes be misleading as a result of how it learns.\nWed recommend checking whether responses from the model are accurate or not, the company wrote.\nThe rapid development of AI-powered tools has created an arms race between AI creators and bad actors eager to misuse the technology, according to Peter Salib, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center who studies artificial intelligence and the law.\nIt didn't take long for people to figure out ways around the rules that prohibit an AI system from lying, he said.\nIt will tell you that it's not allowed to lie, and so you have to trick it, Salib said. If that doesn't work, something else will.\n15 things AI can (and can't) do\nAI  and its limits\nArtificial intelligence is a technology built and programmed to assist computer systems in mimicking human behavior. Algorithm training informed by experience and iterative processing allows the machine to learn, improve, and ultimately use human-like thinking to solve complex problems.\nAlthough there are several ways computers can be \"taught,\" reinforcement learningwhere AI is rewarded for desired actions and penalized for undesirable ones, is one of the most common. This method, which allows the AI to become smarter as it processes more data, has been highly effective, especially for gaming.\nAI can filter email spam, categorize and classify documents based on tags or keywords, launch or defend against missile attacks, and assist in complex medical procedures. However, if people feel that AI is unpredictable and unreliable, collaboration with this technology can be undermined by an inherent distrust of it. Diversity-informed algorithms can detect nuanced communication and distinguish behavioral responses, which could inspire more faith in AI as a collaborator rather than just as a gaming opponent.",

      "body": "Will ChatGPT end up being smarter than all of us?\nChatGPT: the promises, pitfalls and panic\nBig Tech was moving cautiously on AI. Then came ChatGPT\nChatGPT creator's new feature can show you if text has been written by AI or human\nWe wanted to know how well ChatGPT could handle everyday office tasks. Here's what we found after tests in five categories.\nResponding to messages\nWe prompted ChatGPT to respond to several different types of inbound messages.\nIn most cases, the AI produced relatively suitable responses, though most were wordy. For example, when responding to a colleague on Slack asking how my day is going, it was repetitious: \"@[Colleague], Thanks for asking! My day is going well, thanks for inquiring.\"\nThe bot often left phrases in brackets when it wasn't sure what or who it was referring to. It also assumed details that weren't included in the prompt, which led to some factually incorrect statements about my job.\nIn one case, it said it couldn't complete the task, saying it doesn't \"have the ability to receive emails and respond to them.\" But when prompted by a more generic request, it produced a response.\nSurprisingly, ChatGPT was able to generate sarcasm when prompted to respond to a colleague asking if Big Tech is doing a good job.\nIdea generation\nOne way people are using generative AI is to come up with new ideas. But experts warn that people should be cautious if they use ChatGPT for this at work.\n\"We don't understand the extent to which it's just plagiarizing,\" Andreas said.\nThe possibility of plagiarism was clear when we prompted ChatGPT to develop story ideas on my beat. One pitch, in particular, was for a story idea and angle that I had already covered. Though it's unclear whether the chatbot was pulling from my previous stories, others like it or just generating an idea based on other data on the internet, the fact remained: The idea was not new.\n\"It's good at sounding humanlike, but the actual content and ideas tend to be well-known,\" said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who studies artificial intelligence's impact on work. \"They're not novel insights.\"\nAnother idea was outdated, exploring a story that would be factually incorrect today. ChatGPT says it has \"limited knowledge\" of anything after the year 2021.\nProviding more details in the prompt led to more focused ideas. However, when I asked ChatGPT to write some \"quirky\" or \"fun\" headlines, the results were cringeworthy and some nonsensical.\nNavigating tough conversations\nEver have a co-worker who speaks too loudly while you're trying to work? Maybe your boss hosts too many meetings, cutting into your focus time?\nWe tested ChatGPT to see if it could help navigate sticky workplace situations like these. For the most part, ChatGPT produced suitable responses that could serve as great starting points for workers. However, they often were a little wordy, formulaic and in one case a complete contradiction.\n\"These models don't understand anything,\" Rahman said. \"The underlying tech looks at statistical correlations . . . So it's going to give you formulaic responses.\"\nA layoff memo that it produced could easily stand up and in some cases do better than notices companies have sent out in recent years. Unprompted, the bot cited \"current economic climate and the impact of the pandemic\" as reasons for the layoffs and communicated that the company understood \"how difficult this news may be for everyone.\" It suggested laid off workers would have support and resources and, as prompted, motivated the team by saying they would \"come out of this stronger.\"\nIn handling tough conversations with colleagues, the bot greeted them, gently addressed the issue and softened the delivery by saying \"I understand\" the person's intention and ended the note with a request for feedback or further discussion.\nBut in one case, when asked to tell a colleague to lower his voice on phone calls, it completely misunderstood the prompt.\nTeam communications\nWe also tested whether ChatGPT could generate team updates if we fed it key points that needed to be communicated.\nOur initial tests once again produced suitable answers, though they were formulaic and somewhat monotone. However, when we specified an \"excited\" tone, the wording became more casual and included exclamation marks. But each memo sounded very similar even after changing the prompt.\n\"It's both the structure of the sentence, but more so the connection of the ideas,\" Rahman said. \"It's very logical and formulaic . . . it resembles a high school essay.\"\nLike before, it made assumptions when it lacked the necessary information. It became problematic when it didn't know which pronouns to use for my colleague - an error that could signal to colleagues that either I didn't write the memo or that I don't know my team members very well.\nSelf-assessment reports\nWriting self-assessment reports at the end of the year can cause dread and anxiety for some, resulting in a review that sells themselves short.\nFeeding ChatGPT clear accomplishments, including key data points, led to a rave review of myself. The first attempt was problematic, as the initial prompt asked for a self-assessment for \"Danielle Abril\" rather than for \"me.\" This led to a third-person review that sounded like it came from Sesame Street's Elmo.\nSwitching the prompt to ask for a review for \"me\" and \"my\" accomplishments led to complimenting phrases like \"I consistently demonstrated a strong ability,\" \"I am always willing to go the extra mile,\" \"I have been an asset to the team,\" and \"I am proud of the contributions I have made.\" It also included a nod to the future: \"I am confident that I will continue to make valuable contributions.\"\nSome of the highlights were a bit generic, but overall, it was a beaming review that might serve as a good rubric. The bot produced similar results when asked to write cover letters. However, ChatGPT did have one major flub: It incorrectly assumed my job title.\nTakeaways",

      "description": "Before the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT was unleashed into the world, the novelist Robin Sloan was testing a similar AI writing assistant built by researchers at Google.",
      "body": "ASSOCIATED PRESS\nBefore the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT was unleashed into the world, the novelist Robin Sloan was testing a similar AI writing assistant built by researchers at Google.\nIt didnt take long for Sloan, author of the bestseller Mr. Penumbras 24-Hour Bookstore, to realize that the technology was of little use to him.\nA lot of the state-of-the-art AI right now is impressive enough to really raise your expectations and make you think, Wow, Im dealing with something really, really capable,' Sloan said. But then in a thousand little ways, a million little ways, it ends up kind of disappointing you and betraying the fact that it really has no idea whats going on.\nAnother company might have released the experiment into the wild anyway, as the startup OpenAI did with its ChatGPT tool late last year. But Google has been more cautious about who gets to play with its AI advancements despite growing pressure for the internet giant to compete more aggressively with rival Microsoft, which is pouring billions of dollars into OpenAI and fusing its technology into Microsoft products.\nThat pressure is starting to take a toll, as Google has asked one of its AI teams to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT, according to an internal memo reported this week by CNBC. Google declined to confirm if there was a public chatbot in the works but spokesperson Lily Lin said it continues to test our AI technology internally to make sure its helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon.\nSome of the technological breakthroughs driving the red-hot field of generative AI  which can churn out paragraphs of readable text and new images as well as music and video  have been pioneered in Googles vast research arm.\nSo we have an important stake in this area, but we also have an important stake in not just leading in being able to generate things, but also in dealing with information quality, said Zoubin Ghahramani, vice president of research at Google, in a November interview with The Associated Press.\nGhahramani said the company wants to also be measured about what it releases, and how: Do we want to make it accessible in a way that people can produce stuff en masse without any controls? The answer to that is no, not at this stage. I dont think it would be responsible for us to be the people driving that.\nAnd they werent. Four weeks after the AP interview, OpenAI released its ChatGPT for free to anyone with an internet connection. Millions of people around the world have now tried it, sparking searing discussions at schools and corporate offices about the future of education and work.\nOpenAI declined to comment on comparisons with Google. But in announcing their extended partnership in January, Microsoft and OpenAI said they are committed to building AI systems and products that are trustworthy and safe.\nAs a literary assistant, neither ChatGPT nor Googles creative writing version comes close to what a human can do, Sloan said.\nA fictionalized Google was central to the plot of Sloans popular 2012 novel about a mysterious San Francisco bookstore. Thats likely one reason the company invited him along with several other authors to test its experimental Wordcraft Writers Workshop, derived from a powerful AI system known as LaMDA.\nLike other language-learning models, including the GPT line built by OpenAI, Googles LaMDA can generate convincing passages of text and converse with humans based on what its processed from a trove of online writings and digitized books. Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have also built their own big models, which can improve voice assistants like Alexa, predict the next sentence of an email or translate languages in real time.\nWhen it first announced its LaMDA model in 2021, Google emphasized its versatility but also raised the risks of harmful misuse and the possibility it could mimic and amplify biased, hateful or misleading information.\nSome of the Wordcraft writers found it useful as a research tool  like a faster and more decisive version of a Google search  as they asked for a list of rabbit breeds and their magical qualities or a verb for the thing fireflies do or to Tell me about Venice in 1700, according to Googles paper on the project. But it was less effective as a writer or rewriter, turning out boring sentences riddled with clichs and showing some gender bias.\nI believe them  that theyre being thoughtful and cautious, Sloan said of Google. Its just not the model of a reckless technologist who is in a hurry to get this out into the world no matter what.\nGoogles development of these models hasnt been without internal acrimony. First, it ousted some prominent researchers who were examining the risks of the technology. And last year, it fired an engineer who publicly posted a conversation with LaMDA in which the model falsely claimed it had human-like consciousness, with a range of both feelings and emotions.\nWhile ChatGPT and its competitors might never produce acclaimed works of literature, the expectation is they will soon begin to transform other professional tasks  from helping to debug computer code to composing marketing pitches and speeding up the production of a slide presentation.\nThats key to why Microsoft, as a seller of workplace software, is eager to enhance its suite of products with the latest OpenAI tools. The benefits are less clear to Google, which largely depends on the advertising dollars it gets when people search for information online.\nIf you ask the question and get the wrong answer, its not great for a search engine, said Dexter Thillien, a technology analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit.\nMicrosoft also has a search engine  Bing  but ChatGPTs answers are too inaccurate and outdated, and the cost to run its queries too expensive, for the technology to pose a serious risk to Googles dominant search business, Thillien said.\nGoogle has said that its earlier large language model, named BERT, is already playing a role in answering online searches. Such models can help generate the fact boxes that increasingly appear next to Googles ranked list of web links.\nAsked in November about the hype around AI applications such as OpenAIs image-generator DALL-E, Ghahramani acknowledged, in a playful tone, that its a little bit annoying sometimes because we know that we have developed a lot of these technologies.\nWere not in this to get the likes and the clicks, right? he said, noting that Google has been a leader in publishing AI research that others can build upon.\nShare",

      "body": "February 02, 2023 19:53:51 IST\nRepresentational image.\nIn the Union Budget 2023-24, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has finally found a place. The FM, during her Budget speech, outlined that India will embark on a vision called Make AI in India and Make AI work for India. As part of this vision, Sitharaman proposed the establishment of centres of excellence dedicated to AI that will pop up in the countrys top educational institutions.\nThe minister also declared that leading industry players would collaborate to do multidisciplinary research, create cutting-edge software, and find scalable solutions to issues in sustainable agriculture, health, and urban planning. This will energize a powerful AI ecosystem and nurture top human resources in the industry.\nThe minister has placed significant importance on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive the digitalisation of the Indian economy. The allocation of funds towards AI research and development, and the setting up of a National Artificial Intelligence Portal are clear indicators of the governments commitment to making India a leader in AI.\nThe allocation of Rs 2,000 crore to the National Research Foundation (NRF) is a positive step in this direction. The NRF is expected to support cutting-edge research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including AI. This investment will go a long way in fostering an ecosystem for AI research and development in India and will provide a much-needed boost to the countrys AI talent pool.\nMoreover, the creation of the National Artificial Intelligence Portal is expected to serve as a single-window platform for AI-related information and resources, including data sets, models, and tools. This will not only make AI research and development more accessible but also help in the creation of AI-based solutions for various sectors of the economy, such as HR tech, fintech, health tech, and edtech.\nAI is also expected to drive the digitalisation of the Indian economy, which is crucial for the countrys growth and competitiveness in the global market. It has the potential to transform various sectors of the economy and improve efficiency and effectiveness.\nFor example, in agriculture, AI can be used to increase crop yields, reduce wastage, and improve supply chain management. In the HR tech sector, AI can bring several benefits by providing organizations with new and innovative solutions to address their HR needs. By leveraging AI-powered tools, organizations can improve their HR processes, engage, and retain their employees, and minimise the risk of compliance and legal issues.\nChallenges to implementation\nThe implementation of AI-based solutions in India faces several challenges, such as a lack of skilled manpower, limited access to data, and a lack of infrastructure. The governments weight on AI in the Union Budget 2023 is expected to address some of these challenges and provide the necessary support for the growth of the AI sector in India.\nThe Union Budget 2023-24 took a positive step towards the digitalisation of the Indian economy and made India a leader in AI. The allocation of funds towards AI research and development, the creation of the National Artificial Intelligence Portal, and the investment in the National Research Foundation are expected to drive the growth of the AI sector in India and help address some of the challenges faced by the implementation of AI-based solutions. The emphasis on AI is expected to lead to increased efficiency and effectiveness in various sectors of the economy and drive economic growth.\nThough the Union Budget aims to accelerate the sectors growth,  the corporate sector still has mixed sentiments because the government has not complied with its demands for tax breaks. Having said that, the industry can see the other side of the coin and proceed on a growth trajectory if the announced Budget is immediately allocated and put into action.\nThe writer is the Co-Founder & CBO of Instahyre- an advanced hiring platform based on Artificial Intelligence.

To meet the growing demand for food on a global scale, increased agricultural output is also necessary.\nWe forecast that the machine learning category in Al in agriculturemarketsales will account for more than 30% of total sales by 2028. To increase farm productivity and gain a competitive edge in business operations, agricultural organizations and farmers worldwide are embracing machine learning-enabled solutions in significant numbers. The use of machine learning in various agricultural practices is anticipated to grow rapidly in the upcoming years.\nNorth America dominates Al in the agriculture market, and this trend of dominance will continue throughout the projection period. The market is anticipated to expand further due to the region's booming artificial intelligence market and top-tier industrial automation industry. North America is characterized by its expanding purchasing power, ongoing automation, significant IoT investments, and growing government focus on developing domestic A.I. equipment.\nTop Players in the Global Al in Agriculture Market\nI.B.M. Corporation (U.S.)\nMarket Dynamics\nIncreased Use of Smart Sensors in Agriculture:\nThe rising usage of smart sensors in agriculture is a key trend in the A.I. in the agriculture market. Thanks to sensor-based technology, farmers can precisely map their fields, track crop treatment items, and administer them where needed. Farmers gain from the development of various operations explicit sensors, including soil moisture sensors, position sensors, airflow sensors, and weather sensors, which help them monitor and maximize their yields while also allowing them to adjust to changing environmental factors.\nShortage of Labour:\nFor several reasons, there has been a dramatic decrease in the workforce worldwide. Automated agricultural operations are emerging due to this decline, linked to a lack of skilled workers, elderly farmers, and young people's disinterest in farming as a profession. As a result, governmental and private institutions are being driven by the trend of a declining workforce in agriculture to focus on automating operations by using artificial intelligence technologies in the industry.\nIncreased Adoption of Agricultural Drones:\nDrones with hyperspectral, multispectral, or thermal sensors can spot locations that need their irrigation schedules changed. Once crops have begun to grow, these sensors may use the heat signature of the crop to generate the vegetation index, an AI-based indication of health. Although chemical spraying is unpopular, it is a necessary component of industrial agriculture. Fortunately, intelligent farming drones are minimizing their negative environmental effects. Sprayers and other specialized UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology, including lasers and ultrasonic echoing devices, can measure distance with extreme precision. As a result, there is a significant decrease in the overall amount of spray and chemicals that enter the groundwater.\nLimited Time Offer | Buy this Premium Research Report with Exclusive Discount and Immediate Delivery@\nhttps://www.vantagemarketresearch.com/buy-now/ai-in-agriculture-market-1900/0\nRecent Developments\nMay 2022: AGCO acquired JCA Industries to increase engineering and software development capabilities and to accelerate the development of highly automated and autonomous machines.\nApril 2022: Deere & Company and GUSS Automation formed a joint venture with an LLC in Kingsburg, Calif.

      "description": "What questions do technologies like ChatGPT raise for employees and customers?",
      "body": "If you ask something of ChatGPT, an artificial-intelligence (AI) tool that is all the rage, the responses you get back are almost instantaneous, utterly certain and often wrong. It is a bit like talking to an economist. The questions raised by technologies like ChatGPT yield much more tentative answers. But they are ones that managers ought to start asking. \nOne issue is how to deal with employees concerns about job security. Worries are natural. An AI that makes it easier to process your expenses is one thing; an AI that people would prefer to sit next to at a dinner party quite another. Being clear about how workers would redirect time and energy that is freed up by an AI helps foster acceptance. So does creating a sense of agency: research conducted by MIT Sloan Management Review and the Boston Consulting Group found that an ability to override an AI makes employees more likely to use it.    \nWhether people really need to understand what is going on inside an AI is less clear. Intuitively, being able to follow an algorithms reasoning should trump being unable to. But a piece of research by academics at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Polytechnic University of Milan suggests that too much explanation can be a problem. \nEmployees at Tapestry, a portfolio of luxury brands, were given access to a forecasting model that told them how to allocate stock to stores. Some used a model whose logic could be interpreted; others used a model that was more of a black box. Workers turned out to be likelier to overrule models they could understand because they were, mistakenly, sure of their own intuitions. Workers were willing to accept the decisions of a model they could not fathom, however, because of their confidence in the expertise of people who had built it. The credentials of those behind an AI matter. \nThe different ways that people respond to humans and to algorithms is a burgeoning area of research. In a recent paper Gizem Yalcin of the University of Texas at Austin and her co-authors looked at whether consumers responded differently to decisionsto approve someone for a loan, for example, or a country-club membershipwhen they were made by a machine or a person. They found that people reacted the same when they were being rejected. But they felt less positively about an organisation when they were approved by an algorithm rather than a human. The reason? People are good at explaining away unfavourable decisions, whoever makes them. It is harder for them to attribute a successful application to their own charming, delightful selves when assessed by a machine. People want to feel special, not reduced to a data point. \nIn a forthcoming paper, meanwhile, Arthur Jago of the University of Washington and Glenn Carroll of the Stanford Graduate School of Business investigate how willing people are to give rather than earn creditspecifically for work that someone did not do on their own. They showed volunteers something attributed to a specific personan artwork, say, or a business planand then revealed that it had been created either with the help of an algorithm or with the help of human assistants. Everyone gave less credit to producers when they were told they had been helped, but this effect was more pronounced for work that involved human assistants. Not only did the participants see the job of overseeing the algorithm as more demanding than supervising humans, but they did not feel it was as fair for someone to take credit for the work of other people. \nAnother paper, by Anuj Kapoor of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and his co-authors, examines whether AIs or humans are more effective at helping people lose weight. The authors looked at the weight loss achieved by subscribers to an Indian mobile app, some of whom used only an AI coach and some of whom used a human coach, too. They found that people who also used a human coach lost more weight, set themselves tougher goals and were more fastidious about logging their activities. But people with a higher body mass index did not do as well with a human coach as those who weighed less. The authors speculate that heavier people might be more embarrassed by interacting with another person.      \nThe picture that emerges from such research is messy. It is also dynamic: just as technologies evolve, so will attitudes. But it is crystal-clear on one thing. The impact of ChatGPT and other AIs will depend not just on what they can do, but also on how they make people feel.\nRead more from Bartleby, our columnist on management and work:\nThe curse of the corporate headshot (Jan 26th)\nWhy pointing fingers is unhelpful (Jan 19th)\nHow to unlock creativity in the workplace (Jan 12th)\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

      "body": "Share this:\nPrint\nIn the world of artificial intelligence, the idea of singularity looms large. This slippery concept describes the moment AI exceeds beyond human control and rapidly transforms society.\nThe tricky thing about AI singularity (and why it borrows terminology from\nblack hole physics\n) is that its enormously difficult to predict where it begins and nearly impossible to know whats beyond this technological event horizon.\nHowever, some AI researchers are on the hunt for signs of reaching singularity measured by AI progress approaching the skills and ability comparable to a human. One such metric, defined by Translated, a Rome-based translation company, is an AIs ability to translate speech at the accuracy of a human. Language is one of the most difficult AI challenges, but a computer that could close that gap could theoretically show signs of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nStay in the know with a subscription to the Houston Herald.\nThats because language is the most natural thing for humans, Translated CEO Marco Trombetti\nsaid at a conference\nin Orlando, Florida, in December. Nonetheless, the data Translated collected clearly shows that machines are not that far from closing the gap.\nThe company tracked its AIs performance from 2014 to 2022 using a metric called Time to Edit, or TTE, which calculates the time it takes for professional human editors to fix AI-generated translations compared to human ones. Over that 8-year period and analyzing over 2 billion post-edits, Translateds AI showed a slow, but undeniable improvement as it slowly closed the gap toward human-level translation quality.\nOn average, it takes a human translator roughly one second to edit each word of another human translator, according to Translated. In 2015, it took professional editors approximately 3.5 seconds per word to check a machine-translated (MT) suggestion  today that number is just 2 seconds. If the trend continues, Translateds AI will be as good as human-produced translation by the end of the decade (or even sooner).\nThe change is so small that every single day you dont perceive it, but when you see progress  across 10 years, that is impressive, Trombetti said\non a podcast in December\n. This is the first time ever that someone in the field of artificial intelligence did a prediction of the speed to singularity.\nAlthough this is a novel approach to quantifying how close humanity is to approaching singularity, this definition of singularity runs into similar problems",

The challenge for educators is to find a way to use it without sacrificing teacher control.                      | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. From personalized recommendations to automated customer service, AI has significantly impacted our lives. One of the latest AI technology-based platforms to disrupt the industry is ChatGPT, a Machine Learning (ML)-based system that can understand and respond to human queries.\nVaried concerns, need for moderation\nAlthough ChatGPT is a promising technology in the education space, theres still a lot of R&D work to be done to integrate it into existing systems and ensure that it aligns with educational quality, policies and standards. Furthermore, there are concerns about plagiarism, accuracy, the possibility of biases in algorithms and security when using AI in the classroom.\nAlthough ChatGPT can be useful for students, its important to use it in moderation. Because, presently, ChatGPT is trained on a large amount of data, and it still depends on the accuracy of available data, which leads to limitations in its knowledge and understanding. This can lead to inaccurate or unreliable answers, especially on complex or nuanced subjects. Additionally, a students reliance on ChatGPT can stifle creativity and critical thinking skills.\nChatGPT helps streamline routine tasks, but dont expect it to do all the heavy lifting in all areas in its present state. It might not be the best tool for the job if youre looking to dive deep into a topic or solve a complex problem.\nSign up for newsletters, unlock features and do more on The Hindu\nLOG IN\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\nWays to ensure teacher control\nIt presents a unique challenge to the current education system. The challenge for educators is to find a way to use ChatGPT without sacrificing teacher control. This is a complicated task, requiring a careful balancing act between human and machine learning. For example, a teacher understands a students strengths and lacunae. Accordingly, by teaching/discussing, the teacher navigates the student to understand the subject. Machines are yet to learn from this kind of human touch-based teaching.\nOne of the primary benefits of ChatGPT is that it can significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of teachers in generic subjects. It can help teachers save time and energy by streamlining the teaching process by providing tailored responses to students questions. This frees their time and energy to focus on more complex tasks, such as helping students develop problem-solving skills.\nTo be accurate and to avoid any possible biases in the output of ChatGPT, people may expect explainability from AI models. Basically, it means being able to figure out why the model made the decisions and responses it did. Its important to make sure AI models are trustworthy and used ethically.\nQuestions over sustainability\nAs far as sustainability is concerned, advanced AI systems like ChatGPT require vast computational power and ongoing training, which can have a pretty big energy consumption and carbon footprint. And thats definitely a concern for sustainability.\nWhile ChatGPT is a cool technology with a lot of potential benefits, we definitely need to keep sustainability and explainability in mind as we move forward with it. We need to find ways to minimize the environmental impact as well as train young human brains to learn things to develop their logic and analytical skills by being less dependent on the machine and making sure that were using AI in a responsible and sustainable way.\n(The author is Director, International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore)\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is a Premium article available exclusively to our subscribers.

      "body": "New capital to support customers with powerful generative artificial intelligence technologies\nSAN JOSE, Calif.(BUSINESS WIRE)\nYobi\n, the AI-focused customer communications app catering specifically to the small business community, today announced that it has raised a total of $2.37M as part of its oversubscribed seed round. Investment firms include HRC2139 Investments LLC and IRA Capital, along with angel investors Charles Annenberg Weingarten, VP and Director of the Annenberg Foundation and Founder of Explore.org, Keith Donald, Co-Founder of SpringSource, Jason Young, Partner at Totally Human, and other angel investors. The funds will support company operations, team expansion and product innovation. The capital will go toward several endeavors to enhance the app to remain ahead of customers needs, with a focus on incorporating generative artificial intelligence to augment the businesses of Yobis customers.\nYobi will also use the funds to expand its team to include more AI engineers and MLOps, invest in new technologies that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the companys operations and launch innovative new features. The company plans to tap into the power of generative AI to provide businesses with customized solutions that help them automate their processes, improve customer experience and drive revenue growth. Yobi is fortunate to have Dr. Edward Zuckerberg  the father of Facebook founder and its parent company Metas Mark Zuckerberg, a dentist who serves as a strategic advisor to oral healthcare startups, speaking to his colleagues on optimal business practices (including social media), technology integration and the oral-systemic connection.\nOne of the complaints Ive heard from people Ive lectured is, we dont have time to manage how we reach people from multiple channels and meet their needs. Its time-consuming for dentists who run their practices, said Dr. Edward Zuckerberg. When I met Ahmed Reza, who became CEO of Yobi, I realized he had an idea to make lives easier for those in my industry managing their practices. Dentists have their hands full and are inundated with requests through Facebook/Meta and other online or social media channels. Yobi is a potent tool that solves this major challenge by connecting multiple communications in one app. To be super successful with anything, you must develop a concept that disrupts the whole industry. Thats what Ahmed has done with Yobi, and its part of why I have immense admiration and respect for him and great appreciation for what he created.\nYobis customers will benefit significantly, and in multiple ways, from this newest round of funding and how it complements the initial investment. Customers will experience better activation and onboarding flows, increased brand loyalty and revenue, reduced marketing and advertising costs and a consistent customer experience throughout every stage of their journey. In addition, small businesses can use Yobis powerful AI technology that supports translation and provides a business assistant, call/messaging capabilities, analytics and reporting.\nWe are incredibly grateful to our investors who made this round a speedy and successful one, to the angel investors responsible for our initial funding round and to Dr. Zuckerberg and other advisors for their strategic counsel, said Ahmed Reza, co-founder and CEO of Yobi. The vision of Yobi is of an AI-augmented business app that utilizes advanced technology to replicate and supplement human intelligence and decision-making abilities, helping to improve sales, customer service and revenue for businesses. We developed Yobi to automate communications and create personalized customer experiences at scale. The funds weve just received will go toward hiring the brightest minds and employing the best technologies to develop brand-new features. We dont only want to meet our customers needs; we want to get ahead of them and help customers grow their businesses with the power of generative AI!\nReza emphasized that Yobis core focus remains on building the best product that the company can and on unlocking AIs power for the organizations customers. Yobis all-in-one app includes text, call, customer relationship management (CRM) and team collaboration. The companys AI-powered Yobi Translator and Call Sentiment Analysis are the latest capabilities added to elevate the apps CRM experience. This makes Yobi even more essential for businesses looking to succeed. And it offers a broader range of tools to help them communicate effectively without a language barrier, gaining insights into customers feelings regarding their product or service.\nYobi is a godsend to our startup, enthused Marek Laskowski, chief customer experience officer of the Nevada Tour Company. We needed a robust communications tool to connect with our customers that unified our phone, text and social media channels into one convenient spot. It had to be powerful yet simple enough for our whole team to use  without any hassles. Yobi fit the bill perfectly. They gave us more of what we needed than the big guys offered, and they eliminated the unnecessary complexities of their offerings.\nAbout Yobi\nBusinesses are constantly looking for ways to improve customer experience and typically turn to several software solutions hoping they will fill their needs. With Yobi, everything a business needs to satisfy its clients and customers is in an all-in-one app. Yobi includes features such as text, call, CRM and team collaboration.

      "description": "Generative AI takes center stage as ARK Invest released its Big Ideas 2023 research piece. Find out if ARKK ETF can turn it around this time.",
      "body": "ARK Invest CEO/CIO Cathie Wood's flagship ETF: ARK Innovation ETF (\nNYSEARCA:\n), has recovered significantly from its late December lows as risk-on behavior returned to the market.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell & his FOMC colleagues delivered an anticipated 25 bps hike at its\nmeeting yesterday (February 1), lifting the Fed funds rate (FFR) to between 4.5% and 4.75%.\nDespite Powell's still-hawkish commentary, as he suggested \"\na couple more\n\" hikes are still needed, the market doesn't seem to be buying it. Instead, the interest rate swaps market has priced in a peak FFR of 4.9% (expecting one more hike) and expecting a Fed pivot in H2'23.\nAs such, the market has carried on its remarkable rally from January, as the SPX recovered more than 10% from its December lows to this week's highs.\nARKK/SPX price chart (weekly)\n(TradingView)\nTherefore, ARKK's recent outperformance (up nearly\n45% from December lows) against the SPX from its December lows, as seen above, shouldn't be surprising.\nBut, within a longer-term timeframe, ARKK's underperformance against the SPX since its highs in February 2021 has been nothing short of a disaster for its investors.\nPrice action investors might even consider the recent surge as a mere \"bear market rally\" or mean reversion against a dominant downtrend against the SPX.\nPossible? Yes, if the Fed remains hawkish for longer. However, the recent outperformance in consumer discretionary and homebuilders stocks suggests that the market seems convinced about a less hawkish (even if not dovish yet) Fed in H1.\nThe crunch time will likely come in March when the Fed updates its summary of economic projections  (SEP) on whether it still anticipates maintaining its 5.1% FFR target exiting 2023.\nHowever, the risk-on behavior has also driven global equity markets out of their bear market momentum, which could augur constructively for forward returns.\nWhether ARKK could carry on its outperformance against the SPX might depend on how much more hype it could generate, reversing the momentum of its two-year underperformance.\nHence, investors shouldn't be surprised that ARK Invest's recently released \"\nARK's Big Ideas 2023\n\" featured Generative AI as its headline, undergirding this year's update.\nWhy? Thanks to the rapid adoption through the public preview of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Generative AI is the new buzzword driving hype from the US equity markets to\nChina.\nHence, it would be \"remiss\" for ARK not to mention Generative AI in its annual research public release, which is fundamental to the underlying themes of the fund manager's research.\nAs a reminder, ARK believes that \"five innovation platforms are converging to create unprecedented growth trajectories,\" with AI as the \"most important catalyst.\" Notably, it believes that by 2030, \"the market value of disruptive innovation could represent the majority of the global equity market capitalization.\"\nWith that in mind, it's pretty clear that investing in ARKK is not for the faint-hearted or investors who don't have a firm conviction in Cathie Wood's & team's ideas. Why? Because ARK also cautioned:\nCompanies that ARK believes are capitalizing on disruptive innovation and developing technologies to displace older technologies or create new markets may not in fact do so. - ARK's Big Ideas 2023\nKeen investors should note that AI has always been an underlying theme underpinning ARK's thesis (but not necessarily profitability). With Microsoft (\nMSFT\n) investing a further $10B in OpenAI recently at a reported 100x projected revenue, it has also driven risk-on bets, as seen in the surge in ARKK.\nARK accentuated that the companies within its portfolio have a strong \"proprietary AI\" foundation, enabling them to capitalize on their data edge.\nWhy? Because ARK believes that over time, the cost of training complex AI models will drive down AI training costs by \"70% at an annual rate through 2030.\"\nAs a result, the \"limiting factor will be data,\" specifically proprietary data, allowing companies that can leverage such data to significant competitive advantage, including Tesla (\nTSLA\n). Sounds familiar?\nDespite a relatively poor performance in a recent survey on its ADAS, Tesla bulls, and bears can argue whether its FSD can reach its full potential all day. Baidu (\n), China's leading autonomous driving company, believes that L4 autonomous driving could come sooner than the market thinks.\nCEO Robin Li highlighted that deep learning could have more widespread implications for society and \"\nwould be the fourth technological revolution,\" bringing \"greater efficiency and economic growth than imagined.\"\nTesla investors should recall in its recent earnings call, management highlighted how Tesla Insurance had improved its design process and software to reduce repair costs. It has also lifted customer satisfaction while also lowering the cost of ownership. Therefore, as it continues to scale, Tesla will likely gain even more significant insights into the data, lifting its edge over its rivals while raising the industry's profitability bar even higher.\nLi's comments also brought us back to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's recent interview with the WSJ at Davos 2023, when he accentuated how Generative AI could be the \"knowledge worker's equivalent of the industrial revolution.\"\nSo, is this hype real? We think the potential for advanced AI models could be enormous. But whether they could lead to sustainable profitability and moat is still too early to tell, as ARK also cautioned.\nInnovation is complex, but the hype does seem more real than the Web3 hype in 2021. With ARKK's companies in the early stages of their profitability ramp, we believe the hype is critical to lifting investors' sentiments. But, investors still need to separate hype from reality, as many AI-first companies might not move successfully to commercialization.\nHowever, this hype could prove more sustainable as \"the demos are unbelievable in AI.\" Respected strategist Edward Yardeni also articulated:\nWe've been tracking the rollout of robots and artificial intelligence for years and see more industries than ever using robots to work smarter and more effectively, with increased efficiency, productivity, and agility. -\nCan ARKK turn it around this time? We think its December lows could represent the ultimate lows for Cathie Wood's flagship fund. But, keen investors are encouraged to wait for a pullback first, as consolidation seems overdue.\nRating: Hold (Revise from Speculative Buy).\nAre you looking to strategically enter the market and optimize gains?\nUnlock the key to successful growth stock investments with our expert guidance on identifying lower-risk entry points and capitalizing on them for long-term profits.

      "body": ",\nFeb. 2, 2023\n/PRNewswire/ -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the forefront of technological innovations, with ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI, leading the new wave of interactive language based chatbots. Major tech conglomerates are also in the race to create their own versions of chatbots capable of conversing with a person via text and generate a wide range of content upon request. Last week, Microsoft confirmed that it is extending its partnership with OpenAI with a rumored investment of\nUSD 10 Billion\n. Additionally, CNBC reported yesterday that Google is working on a project under its cloud unit called \"Atlas,\" which is a \"code red\" effort to respond to ChatGPT. Furthermore, one of the test products is a chatbot called Apprentice Bard, which uses Google's conversation technology LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Overall, according to data provided by Precedence Research, the global artificial intelligence (AI) software market size was estimated at\nUSD 138.4 Billion\nin 2022, and is expected to surpass\nUSD 1.09 Trillion\nby 2032 with a CAGR of 22.97%. React Gaming Group Inc. (TSX-V: RGG) (OTC: ITMZF), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ: DKNG), C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE: AI)\nAI can be utilized across a wide range of industries and be used by professionals and users from all industries. In the gaming industry, AI manifests itself by providing real-time statistics about eSports players, teams and events that inform betting odds and provide context to bettors.Due to its digital nature, eSports requires more data driven capabilities than traditional sports. Companies like IBM recognized this need. IBM has recently introduced Power Rankings with\nWatson\n, an AI-powered method of evaluating player and team performances in the Overwatch League. In addition, AI can also identify risky betting behaviors and illegal operations.\nReact Gaming Group Inc.\n(TSX-V: RGG) (OTCQB: ITMZF) announced yesterday breaking news regarding, \"its 2023 plans to enhance the capabilities of its online esports tournament and betting platforms, Compete.gg and LOOT.BET, through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and machine learning (ML) techniques.\n\"Esports is a large and growing market with revenues that are expected to reach\n$1.87 billion\nin 2025, according to market analytics firm Statista. As this booming industry grows, AI is widely seen as having the potential to bring about significant revenue opportunities in the next decade. AI's ability to automate repetitive tasks, make smart decisions, and analyze large amounts of data faster than humans, makes it a valuable tool for businesses across various industries, including gaming and esports. In the online esports space, AI can help improve tournament organization and player engagement, provide valuable insights for sponsors, and streamline betting and wagering processes, amongst many other applications that could benefit Compete.gg and LOOT.BET. This is why we will focus in 2023 on enhancing our AI capabilities in both our online esports platforms,\" said\nLeigh Hughes\n, CEO of React Gaming.\nIn any sport, the ability to analyse performance and use that insight to predict the outcome is very valuable. Esports are different from traditional sports in that everything about them is digital. These digital landscapes generate a huge amount of data, in a way that no other sport can. This gives AI a huge advantage for analysis and prediction.\nReact Gaming's primary goal with Compete.gg is to pursue the development of its universal and accessible esports tournament platform that enables gamers worldwide to win money playing their favorite video games. AI and machine learning would come into play here by helping the Corporation to further develop its Smart AI Tournament System, which would enable it to scale with demand and facilitate and run online esports tournaments in a much more straightforward and effective manner. More precisely, this would involve exploring the exciting possibilities of AI technology to revolutionize the online esports tournament space. Our goal is to utilize AI algorithms to generate the fairest and most competitive tournaments possible, in real time. These algorithms will consider player performance, past tournament results, and various other factors to craft optimized schedules, matchups, and pairings. We also plan to use AI to help tournament organizers (TO), of any size, quickly establish a home for themselves on our platform, making it easier for TOs to run and facilitate a wide array of esports tournaments online while also strengthening their brand recognition.\nWith LOOT.BET, AI would be used to generate live-data integration, in-game analytics, predictive modeling and personalized recommendations, just to name a few. AI and ML would work together to derive high-quality insights that could be very useful for the people betting on React Gaming's LOOT.BET esports platform, while enhancing its performance.\n'Our main goal will be to use AI and ML to provide a best-in-class experience for our users, prevent cheating, and predict outcomes of matches to provide keen insights for our players, which could all lead to increased fan engagement, the main revenue driver in esports,' concluded Mr. Hughes.\"\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\n(NYSE: IBM) reported yesterday a collaboration to use IBM's artificial intelligence (AI) technology to discover new insights in NASA's massive trove of Earth and geospatial science data. The joint work will apply AI foundation model technology to NASA's Earth-observing satellite data for the first time. Foundation models are types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another. These models have rapidly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) technology over the last five years, and IBM is pioneering applications of foundation models beyond language.\nIntel Corporation\n(NASDAQ: INTC) announced on a blog post from December that Intel, Habana Labs and Hugging Face have continued to improve efficiencies and lower barriers for adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) through open-source projects, integrated developer experiences and scientific research. This work resulted in key advancements and efficiencies for building and training high-quality transformer models. Transformer models deliver advanced performance on a wide range of machine and deep learning tasks like natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), speech and others.\nDraftKings Inc.\n(NASDAQ: DKNG) announced back in September that has selected DraftKings as a sponsor for Thursday Night Football (\"TNF\") on Prime Video. The multi-year collaboration between DraftKings and Amazon will deliver fans engaging pregame content and unique betting offers every Thursday throughout the NFL season, beginning\nSeptember 15, 2022\n. \"The NFL season is",

      "description": "Human judgement is notoriously fallible. As AI infiltrates more aspects of society, maybe some responsibility gaps are a good thing.",
      "body": "+++lead-in-text\n\nIt all started with an obscure article in an obscure journal, published just as the last AI winter was beginning to thaw. In 2004, Andreas Matthias wrote an article with the enigmatic title, [The responsibility gap: Ascribing responsibility for the actions of learning automata](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1). In it, he highlighted a new problem with modern AI systems based on machine learning principles.\n\n+++\n\nOnce, it made sense to hold the manufacturer or operator of a machine responsible if the machine caused harm, but with the advent of machines that could learn from their interactions with the world, this practice made less sense. Learning automata (to use Matthias' terminology) could do things that were neither predictable nor reasonably foreseeable by their human overseers. What's more, they could do these things without direct human supervision or control. It would no longer be morally fair or legally just to hold humans responsible for the actions of machines. Matthias argued that this left humanity in a dilemma: Prevent the development of learning automata or embrace the responsibility gaps that resulted from their deployment.\n\nFast forward to 2023 and Matthias dilemma is no longer of mere academic concern. It is a real, practical issue. AI systems have been, at least causally, responsible for numerous harms, including discrimination in AI-based sentencing and hiring, and[fatal crashes in self-driving vehicles](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-crash/). The academic and policy literature on responsibility gaps has unsurprisingly ballooned. Matthias article has been cited over 650 times (an exceptionally high figure for a philosophy paper), and lawyers and policymakers have been hard at work trying to clarify and close the gap that Matthias identified.\n\n+++inset-left\n\n+++sidebar\n\n#### SUBSCRIBE\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5c830eaa9d5bf17d94aac27b]\n\n##### [Subscribe](https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/splits/wired/WIR_Edit_Hardcoded?source=HCL_WIR_ARTICLE_SUBSCRIBE_INSET_0) to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite [Ideas](https://www.wired.com/category/ideas/) writers.\n+++\n\n+++\n\nWhat is interesting about the responsibility gap debate, however, is the assumption most of its participants share: that human responsibility is a good thing. It is a good thing that people take responsibility for their actions and that they are held responsible when something goes wrong. Contrariwise, it would be a bad thing if AI systems wreaked havoc in the world without anyone taking responsibility or being held responsible for that havoc. We must, therefore, find some way to plug or dissolve responsibility gaps, either by stretching existing legal/moral standards for responsibility, or introducing stricter standards of responsibility for the deployment of AI systems.\n\nBut perhaps responsibility is not always a good thing. Perhaps, to follow Matthias's original suggestion, some responsibility gaps ought to be embraced.\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind two features of our world. First, our responsibility practices (as in, our norms and habits of blaming, shaming, and punishing one another) have their dark side. Second, our everyday lives are replete with tragic choices, or situations in which we have to choose between two morally equal or close-to-equally-weighted actions. Both features have implications for the responsibility gap debate.\n\nOn the dark side of responsibility, an entire school of thought has emerged that is critical of our responsibility practices, particularly as they pertain to criminal justice. Gregg Caruso, a philosophy professor at the State University of New York, is one of the leading lights in this school of thought. In conversation with me, he argued that if you look closely  you will find that there are lifetimes of trauma, poverty, and social disadvantage that fill the prison system. Unfortunately, our current responsibility practices, premised on the ideal of free will and retributive justice, does nothing to seriously address this trauma. As Caruso put it, this system sees criminal behavior as primarily a matter of individual responsibility and ends the investigation at precisely the point it should begin. If we abandoned our system of retributive justice, we could adopt more humane and effective practices and policies. Caruso also pointed that our emotions associated with responsibilitywhat philosophers call [reactive attitudes](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwstrawson1.htm) such as resentment, anger, indignation, and blame, are often counterproductive and corrosive to our interpersonal relationships because they give rise to defensive or offensive reactions rather than reform and reconciliation.\n\nOf course, defenders of our responsibility practices could respond by claiming that as long as we correctly identify the guilty, and fairly apportion blame, all the suffering and trauma that Caruso highlights is besides the point. Punishment is supposed to be harsh and, in a sense, traumatic. This, however, ignores the growing evidence to suggest that we are often too willing to blame people, even when the facts may not justify our desire to do so.[Studies by the psychologist Mark Alicke](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/3/1454/files/2016/02/Alicke-2e7fnxf.pdf), for instance, suggest that people often engage in*blame validation*, meaning that first they find someone to blame, then they find a way to justify it. Collectively, this evidence, when tied to Caruso's arguments, suggests that our current responsibility practices can be morally inhumane and cause unnecessary scapegoating, physical harm, and psychological torment.\n\nAdditionally, a number of philosophers have highlighted the tragic nature of our moral choices. Lisa Tessman, from Binghamton University, is one of the most articulate and emphatic defenders of the idea. In her books,[*Moral Failure*](https://academic.oup.com/book/6822) and *When Doing the Right Thing is Impossible*, she highlights numerous moral dilemmas and choices we face in life, each of which involves some unavoidable and hard-to-evaluate tradeoff between competing moral considerations. Here's a simple example: Imagine that you are a parent to two children. You love them both and think they are both equally morally deserving of your attention and love. Nevertheless, the world being the way it is, you will frequently have to pick and choose between them, attending one child's soccer match while missing the other's piano recital (or some variation on this theme). This is what it means to face a tragic choice: to be forced to pick between incommensurable and/or equally valid moral considerations. How common is this phenomenon? As Tessman put it to me, moral intuition often leads us to the verdict that we are impossibly required to do something, such as protect a loved one, even if we are unable to do so, or carry out both of two, non-negotiable moral requirements",

      "body": "Image Credit: Getty Images\nCheck out all the on-demand sessions from the Intelligent Security Summit here.\nGetting COVID-19 isnt fun, but the key to getting better faster has a lot to do with getting treatment faster.\nDigital health vendor Ada Health today announced that it has partnered with drugmaker Pfizer on an\nartificial intelligence (AI)\n-assisted application to help individuals that are experiencing the onset of COVID symptoms to get the right treatment as quickly as possible. The new COVID-19 Care Journey application, operated by Ada Health, in partnership with Pfizer, can assist individuals in determining what course of action they can take to help remediate symptoms. With the right conditions it can also be used to help direct users to get the right antiviral medication to reduce the impact of symptoms and accelerate recovery.\nThe COVID-19 Care Journey will be available as a standalone service, as well as being part of the Ada app, which is an AI-powered mobile application that the company claims has been downloaded more than 12 million times. The Ada app uses AI to help assist in the initial triage and diagnosis for potential health issues.\nWe pretty much help our users find out what health issues they might have and then how they can address it as a next step, Daniel Nathrath, CEO and cofounder of Ada, told VentureBeat. Now we are taking the usefulness of Ada a step further and, rather than telling users what they might have and what they can do,  we endeavor to actually deliver the solution to them in a seamless end-to-end care journey.\nEvent\nIntelligent Security Summit On-Demand\nLearn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch on-demand sessions today.\nWatch Here\nHow the Care Journey service works\nNathrath explained that what the service does is it helps to determine if an individual is eligible for antiviral treatment for COVID.\nCOVID antiviral drugs are now available and they are quite effective, but theyre not necessarily reaching the people who actually need them most, he said. Part of that is because people dont actually know whether theyre eligible or not and sometimes even the doctors dont really know.\nThe COVID-19 Care Journey provides a specific eligibility questionnaire to help determine if a user meets the criteria as outlined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for usage of antiviral COVID medications. For those who are eligible, the service can connect the user with a telehealth physician who can then prescribe the actual medication.\nWhile the service is being developed in partnership with Pfizer, which manufactures the Paxlovid antiviral, Nathrath emphasized that physicians are free to prescribe whatever antiviral drug is appropriate.\nAfter a physician issues a prescription, the Care Journey service can also help to make sure that the drug reaches the patient as quickly as possible, which is crucial when it comes to antiviral treatments as they need to be taken in the first few days to be effective.\nThe idea here is really to make the whole journey a lot more painless for the patient, Nathrath said. If you have an infectious disease, the last thing you want  and the last thing everyone else wants  is that you sit in the waiting room of your family doctors office, and you pass along the infection to 10 more people.\nThe AI doctor will see you now\nThe core of the Ada application relies on an AI system that the company has been developing over the last dozen years.\nNathrath explained that his companys AI has been training on a very large curated medical knowledge base. Its an effort that he said has involved hundreds of doctors to fine-tune and get the correct results.\nAs part of the AI development process, Ada Health developed its own domain-specific programming language. With that language, it is able to potentially identify several thousand different diseases and tens of thousands of symptoms. The information is all collected as structured data and behind it is a probabilistic reasoning engine.\nA probabilistic engine works differently than the large language model (LLM) approach that has become popular in recent years with AI.\nWe made a conscious decision to take the approach weve taken because its more explainable, its not a black box, Nathrath said. Its a much more guided conversation, then, than the one you would have with something like ChatGPT and for this specific use case, we believe its actually the better solution.\nVentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.",

      "description": "The AI genie is out of the bottle.",
      "body": "The AI genie is out of the bottle. If you have followed news headlines these days, you have probably heard the buzz around ChatGPT, an AI-based language model that can imitate human language and reasoning to a scary degree. As I was playing around yesterday a bit more with ChatGPT, marveling as an AI expert at how far we have come since the early days of machine learning, I was also reminded of the importance of preparing our society and our economy for what is to come.Jobs in the ChatGPT AgeWhile the current state of AI is still somewhat away from taking over human jobs, I think it's safe to say that today, compared to a year ago, we have a better understanding that the speed and scope of this transformation are well beyond our initial imagination. Just search for ChatGPT prompts and you will get a sense that it's not just manual jobs that will be lost to automation. As AI systems become more advanced, they will likely be able to perform many tasks currently done by humans, such as data entry, customer service and even some forms of decision-making. Soon, an AI will do better market research, copywriting, content creation for social media, journalism, fiction and non-fiction writing, and even legal research and contract drafting (probably only needing minor customizations by an actual lawyer). Not too far behind will be non-scientific coding, consulting/problem solving and many other areas currently paying six-figure salaries.Granted, the use of AI is also expected to lead to the creation of new jobs, particularly in the areas of data science, machine learning and software engineering. As AI is used more widely across industries, organizations will need experts who can develop, customize and manage these systems. Additionally, with the increasing amount of data being generated, there is expected to be a high demand for data analysts, scientists and engineers. In general, it's expected that jobs in the future will require a combination of technical skills, creativity and human qualities such as emotional intelligence and the ability to work in a team. So what happens to everyone in their 40s to 60s who might not be able to relearn a lot of these skills in a short period of time? I would argue that we will see increasing unemployment for a section of the population that today does not (yet) feel threatened by these trends.Universal Basic Income as an Enabler of the New EconomyHowever given a basic level of economic security, much of the workforce can have a safety cushion and enough time to find their way in the new economy and adapt to new opportunities. And universal basic income (UBI) is one such potential option. UBI is an economic policy surprisingly supported by many progressives and conservatives alike, that proposes providing all citizens with a basic income, regardless of their employment status or income level. When Andrew Yang suggested that the increasing automation of jobs due to AI could make UBI a necessary policy to address job loss and income inequality, most people laughed it off. I don't think we have the luxury of ignoring it for too long.UBI could provide a safety net for those who are unable to find work and help ensure that everyone has access to the basic necessities of life. This would provide a cushion for people whose jobs may be replaced by automation, allowing them to retrain for new careers or pursue other opportunities without the burden of poverty. Additionally, UBI could also increase consumer demand, leading to an increase in economic activity and job growth.U.S. Experiences With UBIIt's worth mentioning that UBI is still largely a theoretical idea and has not yet been implemented on a large scale, and therefore it's difficult to say what the specific effects of UBI on the U.S. economy would be. In the United States, there have been two recent small-scale studies on UBI. Starting in 2019 in Stockton, California, a group of unemployed individuals received a monthly stipend of $500 over the course of 24 months through a citywide initiative, resulting in an increase in full-time employment during the time period. And in Hudson, New York, the same monthly stipend paid to unemployed participants increased employment from 29% to 63%, over a one-year time period.Challenges with UBIThere are several challenges associated with implementing a UBI policy, some of which include:1. Cost: One of the main challenges with UBI is the high cost of providing a guaranteed income to all citizens. Depending on the level of income proposed and the number of people who would be eligible, the cost of UBI could be quite substantial and would likely require significant increases in taxes.2. Incentives: UBI could also disincentivize people to work, as they would be receiving a guaranteed income regardless of their employment status. This could lead to a reduction in economic productivity and could make it more difficult for businesses to find workers.3. Administration: The implementation of UBI would also require a complex administrative infrastructure (most probably IRS), with a need for systems to verify eligibility and distribute funds. Ensuring that funds are distributed fairly and efficiently could be a significant challenge although easier since everyone would get the same amount.4. Cultural resistance: Some people might resist UBI if they believe it would be a handout or charity, which could lead to public opposition to the policy.However, like anything else, there are ways to address these challenges through experimentation and adaptation.ConclusionThe prospect of AI taking away jobs has gone from a challenge for the next generation, to a challenge within this decade in a matter of 1-2 years. As a business leader and AI expert, I believe it is necessary for other leaders and elected officials to start thinking of how to support people to adapt to the new workforce requirements. That support will likely require a solution such as a basic level of economic security offered to the population as a whole.",

      "description": "An AI prompter is a professional responsible for crafting the prompts that drive the responses of AI-powered systems. What value can they add to a company, and how can businesses choose the right candidate?",
      "body": "Tyler Barnett Public Relations, entrepreneur, artist and millennial marketing expert.\ngetty\nAs the use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow in various industries, it is becoming increasingly clear that the successful implementation of AI is not just about the technology itself, but also about the people who are responsible for managing and utilizing it. One role that is often overlooked but that I believe is crucial for the success of an AI implementation is that of the AI prompter. The AI prompter is responsible for ensuring that AI implementations happen in the most efficient and effective way possible. However, their role is not only about implementation but also about collaboration. Collaboration between AI and AI prompters is essential for the successful implementation of AI in any industry and for ensuring that the technology is used to improve people's jobs rather than replace them. In this article, I will explore how collaboration between AI and AI prompters could lead to better outcomes for companies and their employees.\nAs the person who coined the term \"AI prompter\"and the founder of a company that provides consulting to companies on implementing this new position and department in the best wayI define the AI prompter as \"a professional responsible for crafting the prompts that drive the responses of AI-powered systems.\" They work closely with other departments, such as IT, data science and operations, to ensure that AI systems are integrated smoothly into the company's existing workflow and processes. This is a critical role because the quality of the content these systems generate is heavily dependent on the quality of the prompts used. As such, the AI prompter can play a crucial role in ensuring the effectiveness of AI-powered systems in various industries.\nFor example, in the customer service industry, an AI prompter would be responsible for crafting prompts that help chatbots understand customer queries and provide accurate and timely responses. Similarly, in the content creation industry, an AI prompter would be responsible for crafting prompts that help AI-powered systems generate high-quality content that is engaging and relevant to the target audience.\nIn healthcare, an AI prompter might work to implement AI systems that can assist with medical imaging analysis, drug discovery and patient diagnosis. In finance, an AI prompter may work to implement systems that can assist with fraud detection, risk management and investment analysis. In manufacturing, an AI prompter could work to implement systems that assist with predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization and quality control.\nMORE FOR YOU\n Strong skills in crafting great prompts.\n Experience with AI and tools like ChatGPT.\n The ability to adapt to new technologies.\n Strong written and verbal communication skills.\n A meticulous attention to detail.\nWhen they're choosing an AI prompter, it's important for companies to consider the specific skills and experience required for the role. They should ask potential candidates about their experience with AI systems and technologies, as well as their approach to crafting prompts and working with AI systems. Companies should also ask about the candidate's ability to adapt to new technologies, their attention to detail and their written and verbal communication skills.\nTo assess a candidate's skills and approach to the role, companies can provide hands-on tasks such as crafting prompts for a specific AI system or working with a chatbot to understand customer queries and provide accurate responses. This will give the company a better understanding of the candidate's abilities and whether they are a good fit for the role.\nAnother important aspect to consider is the experience the candidate has in the industry the company operates in. The candidate should have a good understanding of how to implement AI in the company's specific field. Companies can also ask for references or case studies from previous clients the candidate has worked with.\nIn order to choose the right AI prompter, companies should have a thorough understanding of the specific skills and experience required for the role. They should also conduct assessments of the candidate's abilities through hands-on tasks and gain an understanding of the candidate's experience in the industry.\nIn conclusion, the use of AI technology is rapidly growing across various industries, and AI promoters could be helpful in ensuring the successful implementation of AI. Collaboration between AI and AI promoters could help ensure that the technology is used to improve people's jobs rather than replace them. I believe the future of content creation and many other industries will be shaped by AI, and the companies that embrace it will be the ones that thrive in this new era. Therefore, it's important for companies to understand the benefits and challenges of AI implementation and ensure that they are using the technology in the most efficient and effective way possible.",

      "body": "Tweet\nIts not an uncommon view that Silicon Valley is the be-all and end-all of the tech industry. Companies like Facebook and Google give the valley a status in the tech industry that few share.\nHowever, while Silicon Valley still rightly retains its reputation as a center for invention and innovation, London has quietly but confidently become something of a hub for research in AI. This is no accident -- supported by The Citys banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) industry and the nation's technological heritage, London has become a global hub for AI innovation. It has the right knowledge base and conditions for this to continue long into the future.\nAI and BFSI\nResearch\nreleased in 2022 by the City of London Corporation placed London at the top of its financial and professional services ranking, highlighting London as a global leader for 'its financial services regulatory regime, that remains the most favorable in the world.'\nDespite a challenging year, 'UK financial service exports increased, and the UKs trade surplus remains higher than in all other global financial centers', meaning that despite the recent devaluation of the pound, London is ideally positioned to be a petri dish for start-ups, particularly those in burgeoning industries like AI.\nLondon benefits from its well-established financial infrastructure, with regulators, clients, partners, and investors all located close to one another. AI technologies are seeing adoption throughout the world of finance, with the quantitative abilities of AI being of particular use in this sector. Fintech companies use AI in areas such as real-time fraud detection, automated customer support, and investment decisions in wealth management.\nIn the London headquarters of some of the UKs largest consumer banks, organizations are installing chatbots to leverage AI to enhance the customer experience. Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed to resolve customer issues at vastly improved rates, leading to improved chatbot services and better customer retention rates.\nLondons reputation as a financial hub comes from the interplay of ideas that takes place there. Solutions such as LLMs free up employees and resources so that human value is added where it is needed. Doing so will only enhance and cement Londons position as a center for AI and finance.\nRegarding investment decisions, AIs ability to predict trends and decipher unstructured data comes to the fore. The vast data sets at the fingertips of Londons BFSI sector are better analyzed due to Machine Learning (ML) models, enabling more informed decision-making from the Citys investors. Market influences such as shipping forecasts, weather patterns and economic fluctuations are no longer an elaborate game of anticipation but are backed up by analysis beyond human capacity.\nIndeed, London's AI and BFSI industries have an almost symbiotic relationship and fuel mutual innovation in both sectors.\nThe UKs technological heritage fuels the contemporary AI industry\nThe UK has a broad tech legacy across several industries that has helped to create a deep-rooted talent base for prospective AI start-ups.\nAs such, Britain has a potent mix of pioneering historical figureheads such as Clive Sinclair and present-day innovators such as the three founding members of Googles DeepMind, who met at University College Londons (UCL) Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit. Indeed, many of these individuals have been supported not only by the computing departments at Oxford and Cambridge Universities but also by legacy bodies such as the Alan Turing Institute.\nThis mix of academic resources and computing figures creates a culture for AI to thrive, perhaps best demonstrated by the presence of over 750 AI vendors in London alone.\nWhat does the future hold for the AI sector in London?\nA white paper from the office of The Mayor of London committed to integrating AI-driven technologies into a wide range of areas throughout the capital, and the UK is already one of the worlds top investors in AI.\nLondon covers all facets of data science implementation and fosters a flourishing AI ecosystem. The city is home to over 600 companies that sell at least one AI product, amplified by its pre-existing global standing in complementary industries such as law, insurance, and finance.\nThe conditions are perfect for London to lead the way with research and development in AI, and arguably it is already.\nImage credit: Luciano Mortula - LGM /",

The autonomous navigation system is expected to reduce maritime accidents and air pollutants. The approval is seen as significant in the commercialization of autonomous ships.\nTo overcome the limitations on existing rules for examining the new autonomous navigation systems, KR, HHI, Avikus, and LISCR signed a joint development agreement in August 2022 to collaborate on bringing HiNAS 2.0 to market. KR and LISCR have now each confirmed the systems safety and feasibility, having reviewed classification rules, domestic and international standards, and issued an AiP.\nThe AiP awarded to HiNAS 2.0 is a great example of HD Hyundais determination to become a first mover in maritime mobility, by providing the digital solution for autonomous navigation. We will continue to advance our technologies for the safe autonomous operation of vessels, Jung Jaejun, Vice President of HHI said.\nLim Dohyeong, Avikus CEO added that the outcome of the joint development research was quite meaningful because it is the first achievement through the collaboration of a shipyard, an autonomous navigation solution development company, a classification society and a ship registry.\nIt proves that an autonomous navigation system can be installed on a ship and operated stably. We believe HiNAS 2.0 will drastically improve the safety and economic feasibility of ships, accelerating the commercialization of autonomous navigation technology, he added.\nThe commercialization of autonomous ships is highly anticipated by maritime stakeholders. This AiP is significant since it has proven the reliability and safety of AI-based autonomous navigation systems.

      "body": "Print\nSummary.\nOnly 35% of projects today are completed successfully. One reason for this disappointing rate is the low level of maturity of technologies available for project management. This is about to change. Researchers, startups, and innovating organizations, are beginning to apply AI, machine learning, and other advanced technologies to project management, and by 2030 the field will undergo major shifts. Technology will soon improve project selection and prioritization, monitor progress, speed up reporting, and facilitate testing. Project managers, aided by virtual project assistants, will find their roles more focused on coaching and stakeholder management than on administration and manual tasks. The author show how organizations that want to reap the benefits of project management technologies should begin today by gathering and cleaning project data, preparing their people, and dedicating the resources necessary to drive this transformation.\nSometime in the near future, the CEO of a large telecom provider is using a smartphone app to check on her organizations seven strategic initiatives. Within a few taps, she knows the status of every project and what percentage of expected benefits each one has delivered. Project charters and key performance indicators are available in moments, as are each team members morale level and the overall buy-in of critical stakeholders.\nShe drills down on the rebranding initiative. A few months earlier, a large competitor had launched a new green brand, prompting her company to accelerate its own sustainability rollout. Many AI-driven self-adjustments have already occurred, based on parameters chosen by the project manager and the project team at the initiatives outset. The app informs the CEO of every change that needs her attention  as well as potential risks  and prioritizes decisions that she must make, providing potential solutions to each.\nBefore making any choices, the CEO calls the project manager, who now spends most of his time coaching and supporting the team, maintaining regular conversations with key stakeholders, and cultivating a high-performing culture. A few weeks earlier the project had been slightly behind, and the app recommended that the team should apply agile techniques to speed up one project stream.\nDuring the meeting, they simulate possible solutions and agree on a path forward. The project plan is automatically updated, and messages are sent informing affected team members and stakeholders of the changes and a projection of the expected results.\nThanks to new technologies and ways of working, a strategic project that could have drifted out of control  perhaps even to failure  is now again in line to be successful and deliver the expected results.\nBack in the present, project management doesnt always move along quite as smoothly, but this future is probably less than a decade away. To get there sooner, innovators and organizations should be investing in project management technology now.\nProject Management Today and Path Forward\nEvery year, approximately $48 trillion are invested in projects. Yet according to the Standish Group, only 35% of projects are considered successful. The wasted resources and unrealized benefits of the other 65% are mind-blowing.\nFor years in our research and publications, we have been promoting the modernization of project management. One reason we have found why project success rates are so poor is the low level of maturity of technologies available for managing them. Most organizations and project leaders are still using spreadsheets, slides, and other applications that havent evolved much over the past few decades. These are adequate when you are measuring project success by deliverables and deadlines met, but they fall short in an environment where projects and initiatives are always adapting  and continuously changing the business. There has been improvement in project portfolio management applications, but planning and team collaboration capabilities, automation and intelligent features are still lacking.\nIf applying AI and other technological innovations to project management could improve the success ratio of projects by just 25%, it would equate to trillions of dollars of value and benefits to organizations, societies, and individuals. Each of the core the technologies described in the story above is ready  the only question now is how soon they will be effectively applied to project management.\nGartners research indicates that change is coming soon, predicting that by 2030, 80% of project management tasks will be run by AI, powered by big data, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing. A handful of researchers, such as Paul Boudreau in his book Applying Artificial Intelligence Tools to Project Management, and a growing number of startups, have already developed algorithms to apply AI and ML in the world of project management. When this next generation of tools is widely adopted, there will be radical changes.\n6 Aspects of Project Management that Will Be Disrupted\nWe see these coming technological developments as an opportunity like none before. Organizations and project leaders that are most prepared for this moment of disruption will stand to reap the most rewards. Nearly every aspect of project management, from planning to processes to people, will be affected. Lets take a look at six key areas.\n1. Better selection and prioritization\nSelection and prioritization are a type of prediction: which projects will bring the most value to the organization? When the correct data is available, ML can detect patterns that cant be discerned by other means and can vastly exceed human accuracy in making predictions. ML-driven prioritization will soon result in:\nFaster identification of launch-ready projects that have the right fundamentals in place\nSelection of projects that have higher chances of success and delivering the highest benefits\nA better balance in the project portfolio and overview of risk in the organization\nRemoval of human biases from decision-making\n2. Support for the project management office\nData analytics and automation startups are now helping organizations streamline and optimize the role of the project management office (PMO). The most famous case is President Emmanuel Macrons use of the latest technology to maintain up-to-date information about every French public-sector project. These new intelligent tools will radically transform the way PMOs operate and perform with:\nBetter monitoring of project progress\nThe capability to anticipate potential problems and to address some simple ones automatically\nAutomated preparation and distribution of project reports, and gathering of feedback\nGreater sophistication in selecting the best project management methodology for each project\nCompliance monitoring for processes and policies\nAutomation, via virtual assistants, of support functions such as status updates, risk assessment, and stakeholder analysis\n3.

      "body": "their own AI-detection tool\nas imperfect.\nIn one French language course in the College of Arts & Science, all essay assignments must now be completed during class to prevent the use of ChatGPT.\nReva Sharma, a first-year student in the course, said the change has made coursework more difficult. Her other professors are more open-minded about the use of AI in the classroom, though  in one of her writing classes, the professor had students compare their writing with that of the AI.\nMy professors have said that we shouldnt use it to write our actual essays, but we were using it in class today, Sharma said. We all had to pick a movie to write an essay on. First she had us individually write a two-sentence synopsis of the movie, and then she had us ask ChatGPT to do the same thing for all of our movies.\nProfessors started adapting their courses to ChatGPT before this semester, according to Richard Xu, a teaching assistant for a CAS computer science course. Xu said that the class instructor ran fall final exam questions through ChatGPT to ensure that they could not be solved by the program.\nDino Sossi, a professor who teaches an AI course at the School of Professional Studies, said he is allowing students to use AI tools to complement their classwork. At the same time, he said that he is making changes to his assignment prompts, requiring them to be more personal  requiring details an AI wouldnt know. He hopes that in this way, students will use both technology and their own experiences in their work.\nNYU students are creative, hard-working and ambitious, Sossi said. If we can help them think of ChatGPT not just as a valuable tool to engage with academic disciplines, but also as a means to explore the world and the ethical implications of new technology, we will have done our job.\nWhile NYUs academic integrity policy does not explicitly address the use of ChatGPT in coursework, it does prohibit students from violating academic guidelines created by specific schools and departments. It also prohibits students from submitting work that they did not create as their own.\nRobert Ausch, a professor teaching a course titled Cognition in the psychology department this semester, said that his department has not yet issued guidelines for using ChatGPT in the classroom, but the program has not changed the way he runs his class. Ausch said he thinks it would be difficult for a student to use ChatGPT in his course because his exams are very specific to what he discusses in lectures.\nI dont think it is the facultys job to catch students  I dont think of my students as children who need to be supervised, Ausch said. Life will eventually teach them that some shortcuts might work some of the time, but eventually if you cant do what youre supposed to be able to do, the world will notice.\nContact Carmo Moniz at",

You have grammatical grammar issues here and there that need some fixing, but we use AI assistants for that. We're trying to give every step to AI, and that's why I like to call this a performance.\nWe try, really, to be as far from the scene as possible. Try to think of us as the puppet masters very far above.\nWhat do you think the difference is between \"good AI\" and \"bad AI\"  or is that a false dichotomy?\nFirst, you have to define as a human what's \"good\" and what's \"bad.\" I think that might be one of the hardest tasks, and I think I'm not in a position to answer that.\nThere has to be a more realistic standard with humans who work with AI or the whole creation of AI, the whole use of AI  and I think that's probably one of the top questions we have to ask ourselves in the future. Where does the moral come from? Who's deciding what's good and what's bad? What's good to you is not necessarily good to me.\nRight now we're making a product that is there for our own entertainment and for other people's entertainment. So our objective is not to do harm with it. I would say that is a good intention.\nDo you think AI is going to replace human writers or artists?\nNo.\nWhy not?\nSo when it comes down to art, it's very important to focus on one thing: what is art?\nWhen it comes to art, it all comes down to the purpose, because the purpose is giving art its validation. The whole purpose behind AI is a mechanical purpose, as it is right now. We want it to show us what we have in our heads, what we have in our minds. We like to get surprised by the pictures AI spits out, so it's a bit harder to see or to look after the purpose.\nBut artists like, let's just take the big names, like Picasso or Van Gogh, Jeff Koons or photographers like David LaChapelle  all these people, they're working with a bigger purpose behind every series.\nSo at its core, there will always be humans, and it will be divided between human art and machine art, with the machine art being kind of like fast food at some point, where we'll have more for the masses or just a different style, a different or whole other purpose.\nI would hang some machine-made artwork in my living room  or maybe not in the living room, but in the bathroom [laughs]. But I would still like to have an original Picasso or whatever in my living room. Something I can appreciate from another point of view.\nMore on the future of AI:",

And that is all, aside from a feeble attempt to lure in different buyers with the more luxurious Avenir line or the Sport Touring alternate series. No passenger cars, no veritable SUVs, no trucks, nothing. And that is just a little bit sad.\nEspecially when you consider past nameplates that were extremely successful, such as the long-running Regal line of mid-size cars. Those lived across two different stints in North America (model years 1973 through 2004 and 2011-2020) whereas, currently, it is only still going strong in China since its introduction back in 1999. Initially premiered as an offspring of the Buick Century, the Regal lived across six generations and also expanded from a two-door personal luxury car to include a full model line.\nAlas, some of its most famous iterations remained tributary to the two-door coupe body style, such as the Regal T-Type, Regal Turbo-T, or the iconic GNX. The latter was short for Grand National Experimental and was produced alongside McLaren Performance Technologies/\nASC\n. Few examples got the full GNX treatment, and because of its dark and menacing demeanor it quickly went down in popular North American car history as Darth Vaders car, seeing how GM turned the Grand Nationals to the Dark Side.\nAnyway, that is not the case here, anymore. It is neither something that we will get to see in real life nor a piece of OEM interest. As such, you might have guessed already that we are dealing with yet another instance of the imaginative realm of virtual artists. Or so we thought. Instead, here is Brian Mello, a YouTube vlogger dedicated to all things General Motors, who has asked a cool yet imperfect AI tool to design a new Buick Regal Grand National GNX. So, actually, there is no pixel master behind all this new Buick Grand National GNX.\nMello, who runs a channel dedicated to bringing you unique General Motors-related news and content every single week! 4k POV test drives utilizing 3D ASMR sound, vehicle walkarounds, #wouldyoubuyone, and breaking news, usually worked with renowned virtual artist Oscar Vargas (aka wb.artist20 on social media) but now probably thinks Artificial Intelligence can do the same job  and just as well. Well, even though it started with a good base, no, it is not (yet) on par with a real CGI car expert. And that is pretty obvious in the details (such as the wheel treatment), if not the general appearance of the sleek coupe, right?",

      "url": "https://jdrucker.substack.com/p/the-petrodollar-system-a-shift-away",
      "description": "Strange how things are working out, isn't it?",
      "body": "Facebook\nEmail\nFor decades, the US dollar has been the dominant currency in the global oil trade, with most oil transactions being conducted in US dollars, a phenomenon known as the \"petrodollar system\". The petrodollar system was established in the 1970s as a result of a agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia, whereby the US would provide military protection for the oil-rich kingdom in exchange for Saudi Arabia's agreement to price its oil exports in US dollars and to recycle its surplus oil revenues back into US assets.\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a shift away from the petrodollar system as other countries and currencies have gained more prominence in the global oil trade. This shift can be attributed to several factors, including the rise of new oil-producing countries, the growing role of non-US currencies in international trade, and the declining role of the US dollar as the world's dominant currency.\nOne of the major drivers of this shift is the growing economic power of countries like China and Russia, which have been actively seeking to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and increase their use of their own currencies in international trade. These countries have also been investing in infrastructure and making deals with other countries to facilitate the trade of oil in their own currencies, bypassing the US dollar.\nAnother factor contributing to the shift away from the petrodollar system is the increasing use of digital currencies and blockchain technology in international trade. These new technologies have the potential to greatly reduce the dependence on traditional currencies, such as the US dollar, in the global oil trade.\nDespite these changes, the US dollar still remains the dominant currency in the global oil trade, and it is unlikely that it will lose its position as the primary currency in this market in the near future. However, the trend towards a more diversified global oil trade, with multiple currencies being used, is likely to continue.\nIn conclusion, the shift away from the petrodollar system is a reflection of the changing economic landscape, with new players and technologies emerging, and the increasing diversification of international trade. As the world moves towards a more multipolar economic order, it will be interesting to see how the role of the US dollar and other currencies evolves in the global oil trade.\nThis Article Written by ChatGPT\nEditor's Commentary:\nSo, for those who may have noticed a shift in the tone of the article above compared to past articles I've posted regarding the petrodollar, it's because this article was a trap. I wanted to see how many people could sniff out that this post was not written by a person. It was written by ChatGPT based on the query, \"Write an article about the shift away from the petrodollar.\"\nI apologize for conning you, but until today I did not realize the sophistication and command of both language and context that this artificial intelligence engine possesses. It's not a great article by any means, but it passes the smell test as a brief analysis of the current circumstance. It's wrong on one note; the U.S. dollar DOES have a high chance of being usurped in the global oil trade in the near future. But outside of that, the article written by AI is practically indistinguishable from one written by a staff writer at a national publication.\nThis wakeup call (for me, at least) was prompted by\nan article I read and published about AI written in part by Frank Miele\n. I say \"in part\" because his was the first I'd ever read (as far as I know) that was written by ChatGPT. One can argue that if it's able to improve just a bit, it could legitimately replace journalists. And it's not just writers who should be concerned. AI's ability to project life-like videos and \"deep fake\" representations of actual people means we could soon see the evening news written and reported completely by AI.\nAgain, I apologize for misleading you with the opening part of the article. It came as a shock to me and I felt it necessary to use the same element of surprise to hopefully wake others up to the dystopian future that may be in store for us if we don't start pushing back now. Some may argue that it's not that big of a deal, that artificial intelligence replacing some of our jobs will lead to better things for most. That's the argument I've been hearing for a while and I don't completely disagree... at first. But once we project how this all plays out, it becomes clear that continuing down this road could create a brand new existential threat against humanity. If there's a 1% chance of it, I refuse to entertain the idea.\nI, for one, will not be welcoming our new artificial intelligence overlords.\nIf you have the means and appreciate what we do (other than this con with the ChatGPT article), please consider a",

      "body": "How Brands and Agencies Are Experimenting With ChatGPT From Copywriting to Chatbots\nBut in programmatic, the DSP can be the black box, said Ana Milicevic, co-founder of programmatic consultancy Sparrow Advisors.\nIn the early days of programmatic, youd select a DSP and leave it to their mostly black box algorithm to execute whatever buying strategy youve implemented, she said. If you werent happy with the performance, youd just change who youre buying through.\nAs a means for marketers to wrest control of the often murky programmatic supply chain, custom algorithms are as much a result of another industry trend, supply path optimization, as they are a consequence of the embrace of AI.\nNow we are at the stage when brands have complex custom journeys, many potential touch points with customers, Milicevic said. It makes sense for buying optimization algorithms to make a difference not just for the biggest spenders  but for just about everyone with sufficient bidding volume.\nChalice Custom Algorithms and Scibids, two ad-tech firms specializing in custom algorithms, have seen significant growth recently, reflecting interest in the space. Chalice Custom Algorithms is pacing for three times year-over-year revenue growth in 2022 and is profitable, said CEO Adam Heimlich. Scibids revenue has doubled year over year since its founding in 2016, said CMO Nadia Gonzalez.\nUsing AI to find the best path\nDSPs tend to optimize more for media KPIs rather than lower-funnel goals, said Rinaldi. For example, a standard DSP goal would optimize a campaign for video completion rates, meaning serving ads to people more likely to watch the whole video, he said.\nBut people who watch a full ad might not be the most likely to actually buy a product. For this, it would be better to create an algorithm based on The Hershey Companys sales data, see how video completion correlated, and then rejigger the API accordingly, Rinaldi said.\nThe customizable aspect is the key part to this, and what the advantage is.\nWu Mahmood, evp of addressable strategy and activation at Matterkind\nIn another example, a DSP may prioritize reach over value.\n[If I] have markets such as New York and Kalamazoo, Michigan, if Im buying in a DSP, its going to buy more impressions in New York, Rinaldi said. It may not be as important as the impressions in Kalamazoo.\nReflecting custom algorithms potential, a travel client of media agency Brainlabs found a 120% increase in flight bookings and a 110% increase in click volumes during the six months the company used custom algorithms, compared to six months without custom algorithms, said Brainlabs VP of Programmatic North America Anjlee Majmudar.",

With that in mind, Teams Premium introduces a number of new features that rely heavily on the use of artificial intelligence.Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, the same language model used for ChatGPT, Microsoft is turning a number of meeting-related tasks into automatic processes under the heading of \"intelligent recap.\" Teams Premium subscribers will get automatically-generated meeting notes, recommended tasks, and personalized highlights created for them as part of the service.\n    \n        \n    \nAI-generated chapters will automatically divide any meeting up using the meeting transcript to allow for easier navigation. Personalized timeline markers will show when you joined a meeting (so it's easy to see what you missed), highlights when your name gets mentioned, and when a screen was shared. Speaker timeline markers are also planned, which will show when different people spoke and intelligently organize those markers based on \"who you work most closely with,\" e.g. your manager.Premium subscribers can also look forward to AI-generated notes written by GPT-3.5, AI-generated tasks suggesting what needs to be done following each meeting, and live translation for captions. Translations are performed in real-time using AI and 40 spoken languages are supported. There's also the ability to use branding logos and colors, organization backgrounds, customized meeting templates (e.g. client call, brainstorming meeting, help desk call), virtual appointments for contacting customers, and easy webinar hosting.Microsoft is also introducing \"advanced meeting protection\" for Teams Premium. Subscribers will be able to use watermarks and limit who can record meetings, enable end-to-end encryption while also disabling specific features for sensitive meetings, and take advantage of sensitivity labels using Microsoft Purview.  Microsoft Teams Premium offers a 30-day free trial and then costs $10 per user per month. However, anyone subscribing before July 1 this year will only pay $7 per user per month.

      "description": "SwitchOn eliminates defects in manufacturing by automating quality inspection through AI-powered vision inspection systems that supercharge quality assurance processes.",
      "body": "Launched in 2017, SwitchOn eliminates defects in manufacturing by automating quality inspection through AI-powered vision inspection systems that supercharge quality assurance processes.Aniruddha and Avra Banerjee had seen the automotive manufacturing industry very closely as a part of their earlier jobs, and had spent hours understanding the manufacturing environment. While we saw that most of the manufacturing process itself was completely automated (with the use of Robots, Cobots, others,) the quality inspection was largely a manual process. This was slow, error-prone, and led to customer-recalls and product complaints on a regular basis. This is something we felt strongly about and wanted to automate, Aniruddha explained.While manufacturers had a bunch of convention quality inspection systems doing dimension check applications, surface inspection was still a very complex task. The systems setup for surface inspection needed 100+ images for each defect category, which customers would take over six months to configure and set up. This led to huge dissatisfaction and failure of most AI projects in the ecosystem.The initial journey The duo noticed that while AI and automation played a big role in the software industry, there was a lack of smart technologies like them in the manufacturing industry. It was this gap that led them to innovate in the Industry 4.0 space with SwitchOn.SwitchOn helps precision manufacturing Industries drastically reduce their manufacturing defects through the use of a one-of-a-kind field-trainable AI system. Automotive and CPG companies globally employ 25 over percent of their workforce on inspecting product quality and yet face 500+ customer complaints per year per site leading to over $120 million in losses. The SwitchOn DeepInspect system can be trained by quality inspectors on the field to inspect complex surface defects and eliminate customer complaints through AI-on-the-Edge. Leading global manufacturers such as SKF, ITC, Unilever, and others are using the SwitchOn platform to give quality superpowers to their inspectors and ensure zero defects in their plants.The SwitchOn differenceA major problem SwitchOn helped tackle is manufacturing defects in bottles. Over 72 percent of customers do not buy products due to this, and even refuse to associate their brand with bad experience.They noticed that their customers were manufacturing bottles at a high speed of 350+ parts per minute so manual inspection of each bottle was not possible. In high speed lines even miniscule dirt inside empty bottles can lead to over 6 percent manufacturing defects, with the majority being shipped to the customer inside the box that cannot be seen. And in the world of high compliance risk in the supply chain, a defect in the labels or a change in the fill-level can cause up to 20 percent impact to manufacturer margins.To that end, SwitchOn deployed their AI-powered SwitchOn DeepInspect System within three weeks to do a comprehensive inspection of their customers high-speed bottling lines. Customers can configure the hardware and software through one-click configuration software enabling them to flexibly inspect 10+ SKUs on the fly at 350+ parts per minute. Once configured, customers can use the AI-powered SwitchOn DeepInspect System to do comprehensive inspection of empty, filled, and labelled bottles through a single system.They can visualise their line performance through integrated Industry 4.0 platform helping them root-cause manufacturing issues.The impact There were zero customer complaints in the products manufactured at the plant leading to improvement in wholesale margins, and there was over 80 percent reduction in cost of quality due to reduced manual inspection cost and regulatory compliant liability.The path aheadThe founders say that they are rapidly expanding across the US and India, and are raising their Series-A round to fuel the growth. We are seeing a rapid growth in adoption in both expansion across current customers as well as new customers in US and India, Aniruddha added. Through the funding, they aim to set up teams in the US and India and support their customers better. We are also looking to take our team from 24 to 60 in the next couple of quarters. In the long-term, our vision is to enable manufacturing companies reach zero-defects, he signed off.About Community VoicesCommunity Voices is a series of articles from the Plugin Alliance that spotlights solutions and startups helping Indias manufacturing and supply chain industries benefit from smart technology.

      "body": "Those hands are seriously creepy.\nSalad Hands\nState-of-the-art AI-powered image generators are seriously powerful. They can generate believable images of practically anything you can think of  all from a simple text prompt.\nBut they're not 100 percent perfect, and have a particular weak point when it comes to rendering human hands, as BuzzFeed News reports, a common issue that even the most powerful AIs such as Midjourney are seriously struggling with. As to why? It's complicated.\nNightmare Fuel\nAI attempts to render human hands have often resulted in the stuff of nightmares. Take Midjourney, the tool that brought you some almost photorealistic yet haunted images of a house party last month.\nThe images, generated by developer Miles Zimmerman, may look like they were taken decades ago by a partygoer with a point-and-shoot camera. But when it comes to their hands, Midjourney's attempts really start falling apart.\nFrom hands with far too many digits to floating fingers seemingly relegated to float by themselves in empty space, hands are the one dead and illusion-shattering giveaway.\nMidjourney is getting crazy powerfulnone of these are real photos, and none of the people in them exist.\nJanuary 13, 2023\nHand Anatomy\nBut why is it struggling so much with hands in particular? There could be a number of factors at play.\n\"Its generally understood that within AI datasets, human images display hands less visibly than they do faces,\" a representative for Stability AI, the company behind image generator Stable Diffusion, told BuzzFeed News. \"Hands also tend to be much smaller in the source images, as they are relatively rarely visible in large form.\"\nPut simply, these AIs simply don't know what hands are or how they are related to the human body.\n\"Its just looking at how hands are represented\" in the datasets, University of Florida AI expert Amelia Winger-Bearskin told the publication. \"Hands, in images, are quite nuanced. Theyre usually holding on to something. Or sometimes, theyre holding on to another person.\"\nIn short, AIs like Midjourney still haven't fully made sense of all the complex shapes hands can take.\nFor that to change, AIs will have to understand \"the anatomical reality of being human,\" as Winger-Bearskin told BuzzFeed News, something that could happen much sooner than you might think.\nREAD MORE: Why Are AI-Generated Hands So Messed Up?

Officials at the company explained that they had no idea that ChatGPT was going to be so popular and that the response they saw from the internet was \"definitely surprising\". Through ChatGPT's massive popularity, some problems have occurred, such as students using the AI to generate essays and other written work.\nPopular Now:\nA helicopter just flew over the top of NASA's Mars rover tracks\nSince ChatGPT can produce text responses at a very impressive level, educators are having trouble determining if the students' work was written by them or an AI. In response to these complaints, OpenAI has rolled out a new tool that's designed to help individuals that wish to check if the specific text was written by a human or an AI. Unfortunately, the tool isn't entirely accurate, as its success rate is only around 26%. However, OpenAI says that the tool is best used with other methods for checking over text and that it may be useful to some people.\nRead more:\n* Prices last scanned on 2/2/2023 at 3:58 am CST - prices may not be accurate, click links above for the latest price.

      "description": "For decision-makers in agriculture, properly utilizing AI can help increase productivity while decreasing waste amid increasing costs.",
      "body": "Wendy Gonzalez is the CEO of\nSama, the provider of accurate data for ambitious AI.\ngetty\nThe population has doubled since 1974, and today, there are 8 billion humans living on this planet. While population growth has slowed, at the current rate, we should reach 9 billion in 15 years. What does it take to feed all these people? When John McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in 1955 as \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,\" could he have imagined technologys effect on our ever-growing food supply needs?\nOn average, a person requires 2000 calories per day to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The world faces an enormous challenge, as population growth requires more food production while climate change increases strain on agricultural production and water resources.\nTo survive today, farmers need to be experts in fertilizers and soil, insecticides specific to different crops, planting and irrigation cycles and weather impacts, among other things, and they are under pressure. Pests alone destroy up to 40% of the worlds crops each year, and farmers must now produce more food while using less energy and water. Due to urbanization, immigration issues and a generational shift away from farming, there has been a farm labor shortage globally for years, which means farmers also need to reduce their reliance on a workforce. A successful crop cycle has never been more dependent on technology.\nThe autonomous-farming industry is beginning to boom, with approximately 200 AI-based agricultural startups in the U.S. alone. Examples of artificial intelligence on farms include self-driving tractors and combine harvesters, robot swarms for crop inspection and autonomous sprayers. Indoor farming companies like Plenty and AppHarvest are also using AI and computer vision to collect data on crops and adjust the environment for optimal nutrition and flavor. They also use robots to harvest the food. Blue River Technology uses machine vision and artificial intelligence to differentiate crops from weeds, allowing for targeted herbicide application and less human labor.\nMORE FOR YOU\nFinancial Wellness In 2023: How To Support Your Employees During Economic Uncertainty\nGrowing and harvesting food is not the only consideration. According to the United Nations, an estimated 17% of total global food production is wasted, and food that is lost or wasted accounts for 38% of the total energy usage of the global food system. When food is wasted, the resources used in its productionwater, land, energy, labor and capitalare also misspent. Not only that, but the disposal of food loss and waste in landfills leads to greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change.\nHow To Get The Most From AI\nFor decision-makers in agriculture, properly utilizing AI can help increase productivity while decreasing waste amid increasing costs. Here are some ways to make the most of AI.\n Incorporate multiple data types. There are many available options, including video, IoT sensors, computer vision technology or any multitude of technologies that capture images, light and other inputs.\n Track all data points. Just one plant can provide millions of data points on how light, water, weather and environmental variations can impact production, taste, nutrition, disease and waste. Over time, this can provide invaluable insights that can spur efficiency gains such as improving yield, cutting waste, enhancing nutritional value and minimizing diminishing resources like water and arable land.\n Utilize around-the-clock monitoring and constant AI learning. This can help you make improvements in every aspect of production, operations and distribution. For example, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) can provide image data and train computer vision models, enabling constant information about crop growth and the environment. With AI, farmers are better able to monitor crops to adjust in real time to events like the recent rainstorms in California, or drought conditions, to alter water input or put up canopies.\nCombine operations is another example. Human combine operators have to physically make sieve adjustments if, upon visual inspection, they realize they have too much cob or foreign material in a grain sample. Using AI, you can utilize databases of images differentiating good grain quality from bad to drive sensors that tell the combine to make adjustments, such as shutting down a lower sieve or increasing fan or rotor speed.\nAccording to leading industry analyst firm Gartner, Going forward, organizations will continue to pursue AI to enhance their decision-making processes. Savvy ones that adopt these methods quickly will drive more competitive differentiation and become more agile and more responsive to ecosystem changes.\nIn 1959, when there were 3 billion people on earth, John McCarthy wrote, Interesting work is being done in programming computers to solve problems which require a high degree of intelligence in humans. His words are just as true today as we use technology to feed the planet while curbing waste.",
