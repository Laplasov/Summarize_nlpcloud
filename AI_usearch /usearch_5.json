      "body": "How does artificial intelligence work, and how is it disrupting the tech industry?\n\nGetty\nKey Takeaways The power of AI is evident in our daily lives, from what we log into social media and what we see on streaming services. We take a look at how AI works and why it has such a disruptive impact on the IT industry. With new products in this space rapidly changing the tech industry, Google recently had to issue a code red when ChatGPT was released. Large companies like Alphabet struggle to decide how to compete with smaller start-ups like OpenAI for new public releases of their innovative products.\nArtificial intelligence has been getting a lot of attention lately as new tools have become available to the public that can create art and content from text prompts. The pace of AI-related innovation appears to be accelerating as new tools emerge faster than ever. The entire tech industry is on the fence, and every innovation has the potential to bring new disruptions to current ways of doing things.\nLearn how artificial intelligence works, how it can revolutionize the tech industry, and how to start investing in AI.\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nAt its most superficial level, AI is the use of computer systems to handle tasks that humans have typically performed throughout history. These tasks include creating art and content, making decisions, translating languages, handling customer service issues, submitting insurance claims, providing recommendations, and more.\nThe field of AI has improved a lot recently as modern tools can now create graphics and long-form content from simple text prompts. We recently wrote about ChatGPT and DALL-E 2. These two groundbreaking products were revolutionary in the field of AI and seemed to come out of nowhere to those new to the field.\nWhile these new tools have taken the world by storm, AI has been quietly working in our daily lives for years. Here are some examples:\nNetflix uses AI to suggest movies and content to users, increasing customer retention. Google Maps helps you reach your destination in the most efficient way. When you contact a help desk on a website, you are probably talking to a machine. Search engines use AI to determine what kind of content is best served based on what users are looking for. Amazons Alexa devices, which many of us have in our living rooms, use conversational AI, and the Amazon.com website uses them to recommend products when shopping. Social media companies use AI to determine what kind of content you see when you log on. How is AI disrupting the tech industry?\nAI has impacted nearly every industry possible, but theres no denying the huge impact of machine learning in tech, where weve seen a lot of job cuts and changes lately.\nHere are some examples of how AI is disrupting the tech industry.\nnewly created tool\nAI-powered tools are accelerating rapidly, with new software emerging to make certain tasks even easier. Weve talked extensively about generative AI that allows you to create desired art and content simply by entering text prompts. With these tools alone, machines can now write articles, create content, and generate graphics for social media, many are concerned about future layoffs.\nFunding is shifting to the AI field\nDuring the months of the pandemic, we kept hearing about blockchain and how this game-changing technology is the future. Information is coming out. Weve also seen headlines about Microsoft investing his $10 billion in OpenAI, which is a staggering figure considering the tech giant laid off about 10,000 employees in the same period. More funding for the power of AI means that other areas of the tech industry get less attention.\nsearch engine\nWhen testing ChatGPT, many commented that the tool could be more powerful than a search engine. When you use Google to search for something, you have to filter through a large number of search results, ads, and random websites to find a solution. As a result of these disruptive AI tools, Google has to understand how to proceed as its search engine business could end up being a strong competitor, so its making Code Red. Announced.\nGoogle is hesitant to release a similar chatbot due to reputational risk as the tool is not yet fully mature. Google also relies heavily on advertising revenue to run its business, and there are concerns that tools like ChatGPT could one day replace traditional search engines.\nFollowing the response to ChatGPT, it is reported that Google plans to release about 20 new products in 2023, potentially adding similar functionality to its search engine. In the future, the business model of search engines and the way we search for information will change significantly with the power of AI.\nCustomer service automation\nIBM has worked to develop customer service robots that sound like humans. Lemonade, an AI-powered insurance company, has a bot named Maya that handles everything from signing up a customer for a policy to submitting a claim, so there is absolutely no human interaction. The tech industry relies heavily on AI to handle customer service, and rumor has it that many companies will one day not even have humans to handle customer service inquiries.\nOutsourcing and staffing\nAccording to a recent report from Semafor, OpenAI has invested in training AI to perform engineering tasks so that it can replace software engineers. It turns out that an Amazon coder is using his ChatGPT to help with the work. It is clear that AI will impact how the tech industry addresses future staffing needs.\nWhats Next for AI Space?\nTheres optimism that tech stocks could rebound from the disastrous year of 2022 to 2023 if the economy manages to avoid a recession. increase.\nfurther progress\nWhat we do know for sure is that progress in this area continues to change the landscape. While editing this article, it became clear that Google had discovered a way to convert text to music. Further advances in AI will continue to disrupt the tech industry in new ways.\nSpace governance\nAI is creating tools that can create art from text prompts and content from simple questions, but this space will require some form of governance. Theres a fine line between using AI-powered tools to help you do your job and blatant plagiarism taking credit for work you didnt do. There are also concerns that AI will take over jobs that humans have traditionally done.\nThis means that AI will need governance as it becomes difficult to determine who has done the work. Many school districts are beginning to ban tools like ChatGPT out of concern that students will steal the work of bots. Clearly outlined government intervention may be required to better understand how to handle these new AI-powered tools.\nHow should I invest?\nThe field of AI has had a disruptive impact on the technology industry and many others, but the current macroeconomic environment cannot be ignored. Many of the worlds largest tech companies have seen significant market share losses in 2022 due to skyrocketing inflation, aggressive interest rate h",

      "description": "Overall, budget 2023 was mostly disappointing for startup founders, employees and investors. The few initiatives that were announced were bereft of crucial details and budget allocations",
      "body": "Budget's demand-creating provisions to boost passenger vehicle sales: Maruti Suzuki India's Shashank...\nLet us look at what does find mention though. The proposal to set up an Agriculture Accelerator Fund sounds promising, but is thin on details. Without knowing the size of the fund and the mechanism of its deployment, it is hard to say whether it will have a catalysing effect on startups like the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) did in 2016 or will fizzle out in the backrooms of a ministry. For the sake of our countrys most important sector, I hope the accelerator is decentralised and managed by professionals.\nThe proposed\nCentre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence\n, on the other hand, sounds like lip service to a most crucial and urgent question: who will own the most strategically important technology of our times? Starting around 2015, Chinese companies have made a concerted effort to recruit every Chinese-origin PhD in Artificial Intelligence from western universities. The US government directly supports AI research and development. Unless India makes an urgent and intense effort to concentrate Indian human and financial capital in this industry, we will be reduced to annotating training data for global corporations. The best time to make a budgetary allocation to this was a decade ago; the second-best time is now.\nNew Opportunities\nOn the other hand, 5G labs in 100 engineering institutions across the country is a welcome idea. While Im not expecting breakthrough innovation to come from these labs, just providing high-quality computing and telecom technology at engineering colleges will be a huge improvement on the current state of the art. My only wish is for the budget for these labs to match their ambition (and for the students to use the infrastructure to do more than just play video games).\nA couple of announcements for the financial services industry are potentially very interesting for fintech startups. The\nDigilocker infrastructure\nbeing extended to entities, not only individuals, will enable MSMEs to share authenticated digital documents with lenders. This can massively crunch the turnaround time for availing MSME loans, and will allow lenders to automatically monitor the financial health of their portfolio without paper changing hands. Similarly, the National Financial Information Registry will further enable financial inclusion by providing financial services companies with accurate and timely data to make underwriting decisions. In both cases, startups are likely to play a key role in supplying data streams and providing analytics and decision support services.\nPuzzling Moves\nThe dreaded Angel Tax finds a mention again in this years budget, and unfortunately in the form of an expanded mandate. Now investments by foreign angel investors will also attract the tax on share premium (which was earlier only applicable only for domestic investors). While registered startups are exempt from this tax, the eligibility conditions for both the investor and the startup make this an onerous exercise. I wonder how many foreign angel investors will be willing to navigate this maze of paperwork. This will either push away overseas angels or push startups to incorporate abroad from the beginning.\nAnother puzzling proposal that affects everyone, but startup founders and employees disproportionately, is the 20 percent withholding tax on foreign expenditure. While the intent behind the legislation is clear and laudable (to bring people making frequent foreign transactions into the tax net), it unfairly penalises those that are forced to make legitimate business transactions on their personal cards  i.e., every startup founder I know. I sincerely hope this provision is either rolled back or curtailed in scope before it affects the business of most tech companies.\nBudget 2023\nThe wide-ranging changes to personal income tax are mostly not applicable to startup founders  despite what people believe, Ive never known anyone at a startup whos in the Rs 5 crore tax slab. However, one curious development seemed targeted squarely at founders and employees of successful startups. When such startups get an exit, they leave the founders and key executives with a huge tax liability. Capital gains tax on startup gains is 24 percent (including surcharge), compared to 11 percent for stock market gains. Founders often try to offset this liability by investing the gains into residential houses. Now the government has limited the extent of this tax avoidance to Rs 10 crore. It is hard to argue against the limit and the logic behind it, but the need only arises because of the extremely high tax rates for startup investments. By reducing them, the government can both spur domestic startup investments and ensure the gains get ploughed back into the productive economy rather than being locked into expensive residential real estate.\nOverall, the budget is mostly disappointing for startup founders, employees and investors. The few initiatives that were announced were bereft of crucial details and budget allocations, and we seem to have taken a few steps back in the form of expanding the angel tax and 20 percent tax collected at source (TCS) on foreign expenses. The industry will continue to grow regardless, but I hope the 2024 budget does more to encourage its development. Amen.\nRitesh Banglani is Partner, Stellaris Venture Partners.

      "description": "ASCI announces its latest report on Beauty & Personal care, titled, Objectionable ads in the Beauty & Personal Care category and the rising impact of influencer marketing & D2C brands",
      "body": "The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), in its latest report titled Objectionable ads in the Beauty & Personal Care category and the rising impact of influencer marketing & D2C brands, has revealed how the personal care sector has emerged among the top three violators contributing to 12% of all objectionable advertisements scrutinised by ASCI. While personal care has always been among the top ten violating categories, in the past two years, it has risen to the top three on account of high volumes of ads violating ASCIs guidelines. The other top two violators mentioned in the report were Education (26%) and Healthcare (15%). The launch of influencer guidelines in May 2021 along with ASCIs proactive monitoring using AI-based tools has added to the increased number of ads under scrutiny. With respect to the personal care sector, in the period 2021-2022 to Q1-Q3 2022-2023, ASCI processed complaints against 1,126 advertisements in this sector versus just 347 ads in the previous two years, according to the report. Talking about the report, Manisha Kapoor, CEO & secretary general, ASCI, said, Personal care, particularly on digital platforms, is a high engagement space for consumers, and it is important that their interests be protected. Over the past few years, ASCI has constantly strived to update its guidelines to extend consumer protection to many emerging sectors and platforms. This, coupled with our AI based digital monitoring is aiding in identifying violations and drive compliance. The sector report has also shed light on some of the following interesting facts:  There was a 272% rise in the monthly average of ads processed in the last four years, starting from 2019.  5.7% of ads in violation of the ASCI Code were from the personal hygiene category, 30.3% from the skin care category, 24.7% from the cosmetics category, 19.4% from hair care. 17.5% of ads showcased multiple categories.  Social media influencers were responsible for 68% of the ads processed in the personal care category, out of which 92% violated the ASCI Code and required modifications. Of these, 77% were not contested and the voluntary compliance rate stood at 91%.  84% of violative ads belonged to the D2C brands, which have a large presence on social and digital platforms.  24% of total complaints across categories received at ASCI from consumers, industry and consumer organisations between Q1-Q3 in '22-'22 were for personal care ads.  The platform split for violative ads in personal care was Instagram (55.3%), YouTube (25.9%), Facebook (11.3%) and websites (4.8%).

      "body": "Gartner\nInc.\nsaid AI-powered automation software will account for the largest share of new or additional funding in the year ahead.\nAll told, Gartner expects global enterprise spending on AI and other software automation systems this year to reach $728.9 billion, up from $643.3 billion in 2022. The forecast covers spending on a variety of decision, process and task automation tools and platforms, which companies aim to deploy for as many IT processes as possible. In addition to AI, it includes robotic process automation software and low-code and no-code apps, which enable workers outside of IT hubs to create their own automated software programs for any number of tasks.\nMicrosoft\nCorp.\nlast month said it plans to integrate AI tools, like ChatGPT, into all of its enterprise software and platforms.\nWhile AI and software automation can eke out efficiencies and improve customer services, the top reason businesses are adopting automation technology at a quicker pace is to lower operating costsincluding salariesaccording to a recent study by technology market research firm International Data Corp.\nNewsletter Sign-up\nWSJ | CIO Journal\nThe Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.\nPREVIEW\nSUBSCRIBE\nHead count is always top of mind, said Jean-Marc Chanoine, global vice president of account management and sales at Templafy, a document-automation startup.\nBased in Copenhagen, Templafy automates the process of creating business emails, documents and presentations with consistent formatting and corporate brand guidelines. Over the next six months, Mr. Chanoine said Templafy expects to see a 132% year-over-year increase in document-automation requests.\nTurboTax owner\nIntuit\nInc.\nhas expanded its use of an AI platform with natural-language capabilities designed to route users with questions about their returns to the right tax-preparation expert, said Ashok Srivastava, the companys chief data officer.\nAmong other benefits, he said, the move avoids the need to hire temporary workers to handle surging demand during tax-filing season. Its a classic two-sided market problem, Mr. Srivastava said, referring to efforts to match a growing volume of incoming calls with an army of tax experts around the country.\nAt the end of the line, there is a human expert connected to a customer in the outside world, he said, but a lot of that experience is powered by artificial intelligence.\nPitney Bowes\nInc.,\nthe century-old logistics firm, recently automated processes involved in cross-border shipments, which include determining freight classifications, taxes and filling out reams of paperwork.\nThat has historically been a manual process, said            James Fairweather,      Pitney Bowes chief innovation officer. Rather than have staff workers gather and input data, the companys custom-built AI system completes the job in near real-time, he said. Applying AI to speed up the task allows commercial customers to streamline international sales and ultimately ship more itemsin turn, driving sales for Pitney Bowes, he said.\nThe automated system also improves the service by leveraging more data to better align quoted prices with actual costs, Mr. Fairweather said.\nIn the coming year he expects to increase efforts to ferret out manual processes and replace them with automated systems wherever possible.\nThe automation mind-set is extending to how you automate the entirety of your business, Mr. Fairweather said.\nWrite to Angus Loten at\nAI can bring untold benefits to consumer packaged goods companies, but data, talent, and culture are common challenges, according to Procter & Gamble CIO Vittorio Cretella.\nCONTENT FROM OUR SPONSOR:",

      "body": "Sharp and focused suo-moto surveillance by ASCI in the digital space using AI based technology results in expanded surveillance footprint. The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), in its latest report titled Objectionable ads in the Beauty & Personal Care category and the rising impact of influencer marketing & D2C brands, has revealed how the personal care sector has emerged among the top three violators contributing to 12% of all objectionable advertisements scrutinised by ASCI. While personal care has always been among the top ten violating categories, in the past two years, it has risen to the top three on account of high volumes of ads violating ASCIs guidelines. The launch of influencer guidelines in May 2021 along with ASCIs proactive monitoring using AI-based tools has added to the increased number of ads under scrutiny. With respect to the personal care sector, in the period 2021-2022 to Q1-Q3 2022-2023, ASCI processed complaints against 1,126 advertisements in this sector versus just 347 ads in the previous two years. The sector report has also thrown light on some interesting facts:  There was a 272% rise in the monthly average of ads processed in the last four years, starting from 2019.  5.7% of ads in violation of the ASCI Code were from the personal hygiene category, 30.3% from the skin care category, 24.7% from the cosmetics category, 19.4% from hair care. 17.5% of ads showcased multiple categories.  Social media influencers were responsible for 68% of the ads processed in the personal care category, out of which 92% violated the ASCI Code and required modifications. Of these, 77% were not contested and the voluntary compliance rate stood at 91%.  84% of violative ads belonged to the D2C brands, which have a large presence on social and digital platforms.  24% of total complaints across categories received at ASCI from consumers, industry and consumer organisations between Q1-Q3 in '22-'22 were for personal care ads.  The platform split for violative ads in personal care was Instagram (55.3%), YouTube (25.9%), Facebook (11.3%) and websites (4.8%). Talking about the report, Manisha Kapoor, CEO & Secretary General, ASCI, said: Personal care, particularly on digital platforms, is a high engagement space for consumers, and it is important that their interests be protected. Over the past few years, ASCI has constantly strived to update its guidelines to extend consumer protection to many emerging sectors and platforms. This, coupled with our AI based digital monitoring is making a real impact in being able to identify violations and drive compliance. We are glad that we could get in early, formulate appropriate guidelines and work towards making the online space safe for consumers.The other top two violators mentioned in the report were Education (26%) and Healthcare (15%).",

      "body": "Online tools that can create wonderful, absurd and sometimes horrifying images using artificial intelligence (AI) have exploded in popularity, sparking soul-searching over the nature of art. Tech companies tout their inventions as a liberating force of art for all, but purists argue that the artist is still the central cog in the machine. Art historian and AI expert Emily L. Spratt, whose forthcoming book tackles the ethics and regulation of AI art, told AFP that the art world has not yet found a response to the potentially transformative technology. Are we all artists now? Punch a few keywords into an AI art tool -- something like  Brad Pitt in a rowing boat in space in the style of Mondrian  -- and seconds later boldly coloured line drawings will emerge of the Hollywood star, paddling in the stars. There are plenty of fans of tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 who have proclaimed this as the democratisation of art. But Spratt reckons such tools are more about  entertainment and clickbait  than art.   It is a way to foster engagement with platforms, which is of course going to help these companies,  she said.   The idea that it is solely a tool of empowerment or that it will democratise the space is overly simplistic -- it's naive.  Rather, she sees the boundary between AI and other technology becoming blurred, pointing to the image manipulation programs already widely used.  I see the future of AI as being part of the omnipresent background architecture for all digital image-making processes,  she said.  It will be hard to avoid it because it seeps into all of our digital interactions, often unbeknownst to us, especially when we create, edit, or search images.  Are there AI masterpieces? Beyond the simple online tools that anyone can use, there are plenty of artists labouring over their own algorithms with bespoke datasets. These works sell for tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands. A standout practitioner, said Spratt, is German artist Mario Klingemann whose  Hyperdimensional Attraction Series, Bestiary  is a high point of the genre.  It is a video of seemingly organic forms that morph from one physical entity to another and momentarily appear as recognisable animals,  she said.  Honestly, it's a bit unnerving but it works well as a commentary on the dividing lines between the material and immaterial and the limits of generative AI to replicate the natural world.  She said his art is constantly asking questions about AI as a medium, and more widely about the nature of creativity. What does art world make of AI? Until relatively recently, there was very little buzz around AI outside of video installations, largely because there was no bank of digital images with clear labels. Without the source material, there could be no AI art as we know it today. That changed a decade ago when several projects began to supply huge quantities of digital images, sparking an explosion in creativity. A French collective called Obvious sold a work for more than $400,000 in 2018 after keenly embracing the idea that the AI  created  the work. That sale became hugely controversial after it emerged that they had used an algorithm written by artist and programmer Robbie Barrat.  The reason that the Obvious artwork sold, especially at that price, was largely because it was advertised as the first AI artwork to be offered at a major auction house,  said Spratt.  It was really the art market experimenting with the offering of an AI artwork in step with long-established approaches to the sale of fine art.  At that moment, she said, there was huge interest in bringing together the tech sector and the art world. But the tech industry has since been hit by a dramatic economic slump and investment and interest have waned. Major auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have since worked hard to create separate platforms for selling AI art.  It's like they don't want to sully fine art with these new digital explorations,  Spratt said. And critics are yet to catch up with the field and really express what is good, bad or indifferent, she reckoned.  Unfortunately, the AI art discourse is not there yet, but I think it is on its way, and it should come from the field of art history,  she insisted.",

      "body": "Feb 2, 2023 11:40AM EST\nCredit: stnazkul / stock.adobe.com\nA\nnew and exciting era is upon us, and we are experiencing it as it unfolds. A range of emerging technologies  Web3, metaverse, AI, IoT, blockchain technology, robotics and much more  have been evolving exponentially and are soon to shape the global economy, and our society, and will have an immense impact on our lives. We are not spectators of this evolution; we are the creators of this journey and we have the opportunity to dictate its course of action and its ultimate influence on our lives.\nThese technologies will be utilized in any industry, sector, product, or service, and will enable new and innovative business models to evolve, which could not exist in current traditional systems. We should understand, though, that technology itself is the means and not the end goal.\nSince technology is merely a tool, one type of technology cannot solve all our problems, and in many cases, a solution will involve the integration of several technologies while each technology addresses a different issue of the problem and the combination of them all result in the desired solution.\nAs Abraham Maslow once said, \"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"\nEvery problem is different, and we should be diligent and vigilant to acknowledge and address it appropriately. After all, in your toolbox, you will find a hammer, screwdriver, saw, spanners, measuring tape, pliers, and more. Each tool has a different purpose and utility function.\nIf, for example, you plan to build a house, a lot of components are taken into account in terms of design and material will be used, and so will the tools needed. You would need wood, tiles, and other materials, but also hammers, screwdrivers, saws, measuring tape, and much more. With the assistance of all these tools, a house to your design and liking is built.\nBy that same token, when you are confronting a business or economic problem, you should approach its solution holistically. It is vital that you consider the following, but not limited to:\nWhich technologies could (or are needed) to solve the problem?\nAre the technologies, in their given state, capable of fully resolving the problem? If not, assess the drawbacks, risks and vulnerabilities associated and consider ways to mitigate them as much as possible\nHow can various emerging technologies identified benefit the project? What is the implementation approach?\nDesign, structure, and architect the business model and objectives, while considering the drawbacks, risks, and vulnerabilities that have been recognized, and incorporate methods to mitigate them in your system design and architecture\nEmerging technologies have the potential to create new experiences and resolve social and economic shortcomings. These solutions will most likely integrate and merge several technologies.\nAn example can be found in education. Education is the ultimate social equalizer, which can level the playing field for economic growth and opportunities, but it is also very costly, especially for those who need to acquire skills the most. A possible solution could be providing education in the metaverse, which can bring an engaging and accessible learning experience to everyone  no matter where they are located or whether they have any kind of disability or what their culture, gender or race is. The goal would be to build an accessible, decentralized, borderless and equitable platform, and providing education to the communities who need it the most.\nBut such an experience would not exist without the utilization of Web3, blockchain technology, AI, or IoT. Web3 is needed for seamless accessibility and decentralization. Blockchain technology is needed for security and efficiency of information sharing, enabling transactions in the virtual world as well as transactions and information sharing between the virtual space and the physical space, and the authentication of avatars and any assets in the metaverse via non-fungible tokens (NFTs.) AI would allow for monitoring and analyzing information and activities in the metaverse as well as increasing the effectiveness of engagement and learning. IoT would facilitate the gathering of information, and real-time interactions with resources outside a metaverse space and within other metaverse spaces.\nThis solution would require a holistic approach to achieve the desired result, while understanding the technology challenges as well as addressing user concerns such as user rights, privacy protection and the security of their information.\nThe dual purpose of technology\nTechnology is a tool. Like any tool it can be used for good or for evil. Consider a knife. You can use it to cut vegetables for your salad or you can use it as a weapon against another person.\nThe statements of U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen about cryptocurrency and bitcoin are an example of the duality of the use of technology. In 2018, Yellen said she was \"not a fan\" of Bitcoin, highlighting the illicit transactions and crime associated with cryptocurrency. Then at a February 2021 U.S. Financial Sector Innovation Policy Roundtable, she said: I see the promise of these new technologies, but I also see the reality, pointing to myriad problems ranging from terror financing and drug trafficking to money laundering.\nIn January 2021, Yellen said: \"Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern. I think many are used - at least in a transaction sense - mainly for illicit financingand I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn't occur through those channels.\"\nYellen's comments echoed those of ECB President Christine Lagarde, who\nin January 2021 that Bitcoin had been used for some \"totally reprehensible money-laundering activity.\"\nAdditionally, major investors have expressed similar worries.\nWarren Buffett said in\n2020 that \"Bitcoin has been used to move around a fair amount of money illegally.\" He joked that investors should \"go short suitcases,\" as criminals would no longer need them to carry cash.\nYellen's negative sentiment towards cryptocurrency has changed to a degree and it seems that in 2022 she could also see the benefits of blockchain technology  the technology that underlines cryptocurrency.\nIn a March 2022 interview with CNBC, she said: \"I have a little bit of skepticism because I think there are valid concerns about it. Some have to do with financial stability, consumer/investor protection, use for illicit transactions and other things. On the other hand, there are benefits from crypto, and we recognize that innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing.\n\"Crypto has obviously grown by leaps and bounds,\" she said, pointing out that it was no longer just a short-term craze. \"And it's now playing a significant role  not really so much in transactions, but in investment decisions of lots of Americans.\"\nIn early March, with relation to Bidens Executive Order on digital assets, Yellen said, The Treasury wil",

      "description": "Biomarkers, which indicate features of cancer and are essential to diagnosis and treatment, are beginning their own digital revolution.",
      "body": "Related Content\nHow do we train digital biomarker assays?\nTo make digital biomarker assays a reality, we have to carefully train the algorithms to be able to uncover signals from H&amp;E effectively. This starts with a clinical digital pathology AI module, which has been trained on tens of thousands of slides of a particular form of cancer, as well as its various mimics, to recognize what that cancer looks like. Then we layer in data on what phenotypic features we are hoping to teach the AI to identify. For example, on an invasive breast cancer slide, we would incorporate the HER2 score associated with a slide, so that the AI can learn how to recognize phenotypes that are associated with various levels of HER2 expression.\nOnce we have trained the model to find these features, we can add other labels for other biomarker targets, or even different chemistry-based assays looking at the same biomarker, like IHC score and in situ hybridization (ISH) or next-generation sequencing (NGS), to get a more comprehensive picture. We can even train with clinical data, such as did this patient respond to the drug they were treated with or not, independent of any chemistry-based test, to get an algorithm that can predict clinical response directly, so long as a phenotype for that can be found by the AI on H&E alone.\nDigital biomarkers complement existing tests and fill in gaps\nThis means we can develop different kinds of digital biomarker assays depending on the clinical problem we are trying to solve. First, we can create what we call replicative digital biomarkers, which use H&E to complement existing chemistry-based tests. For example, an AI algorithm might recognize features of bladder cancers on H&E that suggest a strong likelihood that a gene called FGFR has been altered in that tumor.\nArmed with this knowledge from the digital biomarker assay, the patient and their treatment team can send that tumor on to chemistry-based genomic testing to confirm which FGFR alteration was present, and then select the right therapy. Patients with bladder cancers who do not have that FGFR alteration signal detected by the AI algorithm, on the other hand, would not need to sacrifice the time, tissue, or money to test for an FGFR alteration that isnt in their tumorthey can instead go on to a different kind of therapy altogether, one that would be more appropriate for their cancer.\nAnother form of digital biomarker assay we can create is what we call novel digital biomarkers, which create a test for that which cannot be found using current chemistry-based methods or for which current chemistry-based tests are significantly limited.\nNovel biomarkers pose even more exciting benefits. They can be used to help pathologists more confidently identify biomarkers where there are gaps in current testing methods and can allow them to identify subsets of patients that may potentially respond better to available treatments from the moment the cancer is diagnosed on H&E.\nHER2Complete: A case study\nThe potential for novel biomarker assays to transform the treatment of HER2 expressing breast cancers is a great example. Historically, about 15% of breast cancer patients were believed to be HER2-positive.\n1\nRecent studies revealed however that there is a subset of patients who do have HER2 expression within what was previously considered the HER2-negative group, now called HER2-low.\n2\nThis is important because new drugs have come to the market that are able to treat this HER2-low group, such that an additional 51% of breast cancer patients could now benefit from HER2 targeting treatments.\n1,2\nThe problem is that current IHC testing was designed for the previous generation of HER2 treatment, and the cutoff between what is truly HER2-negative and what might now be considered HER2-low is subjective and hard to define with IHC.\nMoreover, there may be patients in the IHC-0 group that actually do have enough HER2 to potentially benefit from the new drugs. The challenge though is that at a score of IHC 0, IHC is not sensitive enough to identify them with confidence. So, we are developing Paige HER2Complete*, the first and only H&E based digital biomarker capable of detecting morphological phenotypes consistent with HER2 expression in IHC negative or equivocal-IHC1+ samples. Our hypothesis is that with support from future clinical trials, this algorithm could enable pathologists, oncologists and patients to better classify HER2 expression and select the appropriate HER2 based therapy from the options currently available.\nLooking ahead: What digital biomarkers could mean for the future\nClinical trials are a very important part of helping new digital biomarkers translate into actual clinical practice and outcomes. Developing evidence to not only validate the algorithms, but to set the stage for regulatory clearance, ensures they are safe and effective ways of supporting pathologists and oncologists, and ultimately helping patients.\nNot only that, but with digital assays being less labor intensive and costly than chemistry-based testing such as NGS, IHC or FISH, these tests can become more accessible to underserved areas where specialists are rare or do not exist, expanding patient care and creating a landscape in which every patient, in all geographies, receives the best possible care.\nReferences\n1 Tarantino, P. et al., (2020) J Clin Oncol. 10;38(17):1951-1962.\n2 Modi S, Jacot W, Yamashita T, et al; DESTINY-Breast04 Trial Investigators.\nTrastuzumab deruxtecan in previously treated HER2-low advanced breast cancer.

Wall Street is clamoring to ride the ChatGPT wave, and investors are pouring into anything that has exposure to the budding artificial intelligence sector.\nMicrosoft's $10 billion investment in ChatGPT's parent company OpenAI has only fueled enthusiasm, and it's not just chip-makers like Nvidia that have attracted new shareholders. A batch of obscure small-cap bot stocks have made sizable gains, and certain Chinese AI stocks have climbed 60% in a matter of weeks.\nTake software firm Versus Systems, for example. The tiny B2B technology company skyrocketed more than 400% at one point on Wednesday after it announced a deal involving AI.\nExpectations at the intersection of bots and finance are also burgeoning. A new JPMorgan survey showed 53% of traders believe AI will have the greatest influence on trading over the next three years.\nChris Natividad, chief investment officer of Equbot, is no stranger to this realm. He helps run the AI Powered Equity ETF, which launched in 2017 and leverages IBM's Watson supercomputer.\nHe told me on a call last night that today's bots are only scratching the surface of what's possible.\n\"We use AI with everything from maps to shopping and health screens, so to think it's not going to become a larger part of the investment space is a little bit misguided,\" Natividad said. \"It's happening.\"\nThe fund has gained popularity this year as people began to notice that the AI-driven ETF was beating the S&P 500.\nWhile many asset managers are limited to decisions based on traditional market data, AI can go through sentiment-based intel like tweets or online text.\nThat gives it room to make recommendations based on patterns that human stock-pickers can't always recognize.\n\"These tools are improving, and the operators that are using the algorithms are improving,\" Natividad said. \"\n. The theoretical accuracy of a model is meant to improve, get better at picking assets.\"\nWhat will AI's impact be on trading and markets?

The stock market rally will fade as the Fed combats inflation and a recession hits, according to a Credit Suisse strategist.

      "body": "Sponsored by\nShare this Article\nDirty data costs the additive industry millions of dollars a year. Material parameter development, operational mistakes, or part failure could all be avoided if reliable, detailed and comprehensive data about previous production runs were available. Beyond the immediate savings, there are several other reasons why clean data is critical for the future of our industry:\nFirstly, it ensures accurate predictions and decision making, which optimizes processes, predicts failure and forecasts demand. Bad data = bad decision making.\nSecondly, it enables effective collaboration and communication within the manufacturing ecosystem. Even the simple case of proving the need for more machines hinges on clean utilization data to persuade management. Its also critical to make sure that tribal knowledge within the organizations is passed on effectively.\nThirdly, it is necessary for effective supply chain management, by keeping all parties informed about inventory levels and schedules. In the future, we might also be able to infer and compensate potential assembly problems in advance with all the right data available.\nLastly, it ensures compliance with industry regulations, avoiding costly fines and penalties. It also helps in the development of those regulations and standards, giving the relevant committees access to the information. It can also help enforce those effectively, by sharing data with auditors.\nAbove all, clean data is critical for the future. Increasingly powerful AI programs rely on clean data to make effective decisions. If we want to get to first time right, then bad data is not an option, as it reinforces bad decision making.\nAnd yet, the most common routes are closed to the additive industry. In additive, AI cant build on deep data such as a single sensor providing data on millions of parts. Instead, the AI needs to be trained on contextual data from the full production process starting with the origin of the design, through the genealogy of the feedstock, to the actions of the operators and the output of the machines.\nThis makes the challenge of capturing clean data all the greater. Deploying the next generation technology relies on moving on from 20\nth\ncentury habits of doing everything on paper. To capture clean data from the full context of parts requires everybody to work together to move the processes onto a digital framework. That doesnt mean users cant use their favorite software to do the tool pathing, or have to forgo the meeting to sign off production. Just that these actions and decisions be integrated or digitally captured.\nOpen workflow solutions such as Authentise Flows AM can provide extensible ways to manage the process efficiently while capturing the process data. But without the collaborative effort of everybody in the organization to adopt and maintain such systems, they wont yield the data required.\nSoftware itself can do a lot to help. New AI can help clean and augment sparse data and well-designed software can make the process of bringing everybody onboard the journey easier. But in the end, the important step is to start engaging people on a digital journey.\nThe time to do so is now. AM part prices are still a multiple higher than their traditional counterparts, yield rates are terrible and AM market penetration in manufacturing is still abysmal. The long term viability of additive operations may depend on the industrys ability to level up. That can only happen with clean data.\nAuthentise is participating at",

      "body": "Kenrick Cai\nIN\nan unremarkable conference room inside OpenAIs office, insulated from the mid-January rain pelting San Francisco, company president Greg Brockman surveys the energy levels of the team overseeing the companys new artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT. How are we doing between everythings on fire and everyones burned out to everyones just back from the holidays and everythings good? Whats the spectrum? he asks.\nI would say the holidays came at just the right time, replies one lieutenant. Thats an understatement. Within five days of ChatGPTs November launch, 1 million users overloaded its servers with trivia questions, poetry prompts and recipe requests. (Forbes estimates its now 5 millionplus.) Open-AI quietly routed some of the load to its training supercomputer, thousands of interconnected graphics processing units (GPUs) custom-built with allies Microsoft and Nvidia, while long-term work on its next models, like the highly anticipated GPT-4, took a back seat.\nAs the group huddles, ChatGPTs at-capacity servers still turn away users. The previous day, it went down for two hours. Yet amid the fatigue, this roomful of employees, all in their twenties and early thirties, clearly relish their roles in a historic moment. AI is going to be debated as the hottest topic of 2023. And you know what? Thats appropriate, says Bill Gates, the person most responsible for a similar previous paradigm shiftone known as software. This is every bit as important as the PC, as the internet.\nThe markets agree. Valued at $29 billion following a reported $10 billion investment commitment from Microsoft, OpenAIspecifically, Brockman, 34, and his boss, CEO Sam Altman, 37serves as the poster child for something extraordinary. But its hardly alone. In image generation, Amazon quietly backs Stability AI (recent value: $1 billion), whose brash CEO, Emad Mostaque, 39, aspires to be the Amazon Web Services of the category. Hugging Face ($2 billion) supplies tools for giants like Intel and Meta to build and run competitive models themselves. Below the generative AI providers in this budding tech stack, Scale AI ($7.3 billion) and others provide picks-and-shovels infrastructure; above them, an ecosystem of applications develops, funneling the AI into specialized software that could fundamentally alter jobs for lawyers, salespeople, doctorspretty much everyone.\nIs there hype? Plenty. The reported valuation for OpenAI, aggressively forecasting 2023 revenue of $200 million (compared to expected revenue of about $30 million last year, according to part of a past investor presentation observed by Forbes), would imply a forward 145 price-to-sales multiple, compared to a more typical 10x or 20x. (OpenAI declined to comment on its financials except to say that the investment was multiyear and multibillion.) No matter that AI insurgents arent pure disruptorsAmazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and others already profit by providing the cloud infrastructure underpinning much of the category. Google in particular, with its enormous resources and decade-plus of machine learning research, is the elephant in the room, says investor Mike Volpi at Index Ventures.\nSocietal challenges? Those too. Theres potential for bias and discrimination in the models, not to mention misuse by bad actors. Legal spats are emerging over the ownership of AI-generated work and the actual data used to teach them. Then theres the ultimate goal that some, such as Open-AIs leaders, envision: a conscious, self-improving artificial general intelligence that could reimagine capitalism (Altmans hope)or threaten humanity (others fear, including Elon Musks).\nTodays AI-based image generators arent self aware. But Forbes asked OpenAIs DALL-E and Stability AIs Stable Diffusion  to attempt to visualize themselves, using an identical prompt: an artistic portrait of the artificial intelligence called X, created by the artificial intelligence X. These were the authors favorites of the resulting self-portrait attempts.\nDreamStudio / DALL-E\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman declined to be photographed for this story. Heres how his generative AI tool DALL-E imagined Sam Altman on the cover of Forbes Magazine  in this generated image, proudly presenting it himself.\nDALL-E\nBut in speaking with more than 60 researchers, investors and entrepreneurs in the category, its clear that this AI gold rush also has something other recent crazes have lacked: practical, even boring, business substance. The race to embed tools in company workflows, large and small, is already on. Calls to AI-based code snippets, or APIs, soared tenfold in 2022, with more acceleration in December, according to provider RapidAPI. A recent Cowen study of 100-plus enterprise software buyers found that AI has emerged as the top spending priority among emerging technologies. Chat-GPT and Open-AIs models are coming to Microsofts massive-footprint suite of products such as Outlook and Word, with most business software makers poised to follow suit quickly.\nA quarter-century after IBMs Deep Blue program defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, the shift to artificial intelligence is finally here. Its an exciting time, the press-shy Altman tells Forbes, but my hope is that its still extremely early.\nNew York Citys Public School System banned Chatgpt, and a Wharton Professor who tested the program gave it a B on his final exam.\nT\nhis AI tipping point also has roots in London, the headquarters for Mostaques Stability. In August, hot on the heels of the beta launch of OpenAIs image model, DALL-E, Mostaque released Stable Diffusion, which allows anyone to instantly spin a line of text into a piece of art, or turn a dull selfie into a dramatic self-portrait. Unlike OpenAIs proprietary model, Stability doesnt own Stable Diffusion, which is open-source. But its become the biggest driving force and profit-maker behind the project so far. On any given day, 10 million people use Stable Diffusionmore than any other model.\nTHINK BIGGER | At his $2 billion startups January offsite in France, Clem Delangue, Hugging Faces cofounder and  CEO, had one directive for his  150 employees: Be more ambitious. Sometimes when an industry gets bigger, the speed of evolution goes down. Here its evolving really, really fast. I think theres potential for multiple $100 billion companies.\nLevon Biss for Forbes\nSuch rapid adoption proved a turning point. Previously, AI had existed in three realms. The first was academic: A seminal paper demonstrating the power of neural networks, a key underpinning of GPT and other large language models (so named because they can scan, translate and generate text) was published more than a decade ago. The second was demonstrative: Deep Blue created an arms race of stunts, with Alphabets DeepMind unit ultimately creating juggernauts in chess and the ancient board game Go. The third was incremental: apps like Gmail, which works without AI but is better with featur",

These were the authors favorites of the resulting self-portrait attempts.\nDreamStudio / DALL-E\nA\nrtificial intelligence will be 2023s hottest topic, and one subject to debate. Thats what Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates told Forbes in an exclusive conversation about the suddenly exploding field. More than 60 other AI leaders Forbes interviewed share his anticipation: after decades of research and demonstrative stunts like Deep Blues victory over chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, the shift to artificial intelligence is finally here.\nPerhaps nothing indicates this better than OpenAI and its conversational robot ChatGPT. Forbes estimates that its already exceeded 5 million users in less than 60 days from launch. Its usage has become rampant in schools  prompting New York City to ban it on public school computers  and its got enough smarts already to get a B grade on a final exam at Wharton. Soon, it will be deployed in Microsofts Office software suite, and tons of other business applications. But OpenAI nearly shelved ChatGPTs release entirely, its leaders, CEO Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman, told Forbes in rare interviews.\nThen, theres Stability AIs open-source image generation model Stable Diffusion, which has been used on pop music videos, Hollywood movies and by more than 10 million people on a daily basis. Stabilitys brash CEO Emad Mostaque predicts the dot-AI bubble is coming. If OpenAI (recently valued at $29 billion) and Stability ($1 billion, off virtually no revenue) are any indication, its already begun. While the experts Forbes spoke to have different views on how the market will play out, one thing is for sure: soon, AI will be affecting the way that you work, like it or not.\nHere are six things you probably didnt know about ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion and the future of generative AI. For more, read\nForbes new magazine feature on the dawn of the work-ready AI era.\n1. Big Techs last generation of billionaire founders are back in the trenches\nBill Gates is excited about AI, and is now spending 10% of his time back at Microsoft meeting with product teams, he said. Hes not alone: at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly enacted a code red emergency, reorienting the companys work to focus on ways to counteract ChatGPT and similar tools. In turn, hermetic founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are back. Forbes broke the news that Brin filed a code request on LaMDA, Googles natural language chatbot, in January  his first in years.\n2. ChatGPT almost wasnt releasedespite its viral success, ChatGPT did not impress employees inside OpenAI. None of us were that enamored by it,\nForbes\n. None of us were like, This is really useful. This past fall, Altman and co. decided to shelve the chatbot to concentrate on domain-focused alternatives instead. But in November, after those alternatives failed to catch on internally  and as tools like Stable Diffusion caused the AI ecosystem to explode  OpenAI reversed course. It really lit a fire under OpenAI, said Sequoia investor Pat Grady, whose firm bought shares in OpenAI in 2021.\nGreg Brockman, OpenAI's cofounder and president, said that before ChatGPT's launch, he thought the company would be lucky to get \"one Twitter thread of 10,000 likes.\" Its Discord channel alone gained two million members in two months instead.\nCopyright  2022 Ethan Pines\n3. ChatGPT forced OpenAI to delay development on GPT-4\nInternally, ChatGPTs virality has been a double-edged sword. Its instant popularity  more than 1 million users in its first five days  overloaded the companys servers. In the holiday rush, OpenAI employees had to shift computing from its training supercomputer, used to train new models like the highly anticipated GPT-4, to helping run ChatGPT. Stay tuned for follow-up stories that may include an early warning of when GPT-4 is now expected to launch. One thing to know now: according to billionaire Reid Hoffman, who donated to OpenAIs non-profit early on, its developed a sense of humor.\n4. Stabilitys Faustian bargain\nMostaque has positioned his company Stability as the AI company for the people  building the technology in a fashion unlike what he calls the panopticon approach of Big Tech. But hes quietly struck his own arrangement with a tech giant: an incredibly attractive deal with Amazon, which has so far remained a dark horse in the race for AI. The cloud giant provided Stability with more than 4,000 Nvidia GPUs to power Stabilitys supercomputer, one of the worlds largest, on which Stable Diffusion was subsequently trained. Thats a lot of computing power. A year ago, Stability operated just 32 such GPUs, Mostaque said.\n5. Money laundering in the cloud\nBeneath all this flashy new technology lies a bed of lucrative computing infrastructure used to build all the apps. The costs are getting unwieldy  as indicated by OpenAIs reported $10 billion investment commitment from Microsoft, much of which is expected to be spent on computing costs associated with Microsofts cloud service Azure. (Microsoft and OpenAI have called it a multi-year, multi-billion deal.) There is a lack of transparency, said Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, which hosts AI models like Stable Diffusion and was recently valued at $2 billion. It leads to situations where we lose track of the real cloud infrastructure cost of a lot of machine learning. Some of these costs appear to be proliferating unchecked  so much so that Delangue coined his own term for it: Cloud money laundering.\n6. AIs end game?\nArtificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a term for an as-yet hypothetical AI that is conscious, self-improving and theoretically capable of outsripping human control (a prospect that has concerned some, like Elon Musk, an initial donor to OpenAI who has since cut ties with the company). Sam Altman believes we likely wont recognize an AGI when it arrives. This end-game is why OpenAI has two unusual setups for a startup unicorn: a capped-profit mechanism by which, after returning a certain amount of profits to shareholders, it would return to non-profit control; and a merge condition by which, should a competitor get close to reaching an AGI, OpenAI would shut down its own work and fold into the more successful project. Altman also thinks that when an AGI comes  for there could be several  it might break capitalism for the better.\nFor more, read",

      "body": "The artificial intelligence text generator ChatGPT has been the subject of debate recently, but lets take the AI conversation a step further, to Hollywood. More and more, Im seeing examples of manipulated performances pop up on social media  altering an actors gaze or the words theyre saying  and its being presented with unmitigated enthusiasm. Maybe the folks behind some of those posts have a vested interest in seeing AI technology become the norm. Expected. But wheres the skepticism? Wheres the wariness? Lets step into the breach. Consider the twitter user who grabbed a monologue from Hulus The Bear featuring Jeremy Allen White and used AI technology to change Whites line of sight. In the new video, instead of looking off camera, hes making direct eye contact with the viewer. Both versions were posted side-by-side for comparison. Why are you doing this exactly? someone asked. The original poster responded with a gif: Some men just want to watch the world burn. The technology can be used on a live broadcast. Maybe thats useful for video meetings or certain interview scenarios. But I also wonder if there are also studio executives whove always thought actors were too precious about their performances and heres a way to tweak some of that after the fact. Theres another tweet floating around touting a different AI program that can seamlessly change an actors dialogue  from the use of a profanity to something more family friendly: This is mind blowing technology. Generative AI will completely change how films are made. Thats probably a good bet. But does that also sound like advertising copy to you? Are influencers being corralled to shape and steer the conversation? Because it is conspicuous that nobody is talking about ethical boundaries and how this technology should or shouldnt be used. The question of AI and ethics recently hit the world of Twitch streamers (gamers who stream their games live) when someone was caught, and subsequently apologized for, buying and watching deepfakes from an account that makes non-consensual, sexually explicit AI-generated videos of his colleagues in the streaming world, according to a report from Vice. To put it in simpler terms: AI was used to make porn of his friends. And he watched it. Even if actor contracts are ironclad to prevent this sort of thing on the studio level, whats to stop anyone else from using AI on actors for this very purpose? Heres what Vice had to say: Most states in the U.S. have laws against non-consensual sexual material, but only California, Virginia, and Texas specifically name deepfakes. Even with laws in place that penalize people who make and spread malicious deep fakes, getting recourse as a victim can be extremely difficult. None of this fully acknowledges the wider danger of deepfake videos, and their potential to spread misinformation, upend public opinion and politics and cause all kinds of mayhem. Heres a different example I came across recently: Audio of Mariah Carey singing Janet Jacksons Together Again, a feat accomplished through AI rather than Careys own vocal chords. Made for entertainment purposes only! the caption reads. I get no profit off of it other than entertainment. Someone posted a response that sent me in a depressive spiral: I cant wait till AI gets better OMG the amount of ideas I have. Auto-Tune is already a thing in music. Is this just the next logical step? Why are we so blas about deep-faking or cloning someones voice? Are there better uses for AI than  this? Or as someone asked: What if we created AI that can streamline finding a cure for cancer or AIDS instead? Also this week, filmmaker Robert Zemeckis announced that Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the stars of his next film, will be de-aged using AI that will create photorealistic face swaps and de-aging effects on top of actors performances live and in real time without the need for further compositing for VFX work. Four years ago, Martin Scorsese played around with de-aging in The Irishman. From left: Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro in The Irishman. But this detail is new: The AI company Zemeckis is working with has entered into a strategic partnership with CAA to develop generative AI tools and services for talent  with an ethics-first approach. No word on what those ethical considerations may be, but Id like to think one biggest agencies in Hollywood is taking these questions seriously as they seek to unlock an incredible opportunity for the entertainment industry and beyond, as Joanna Popper told The Hollywood Reporter. Shes the chief metaverse officer at CAA, which is apparently now a job description at a major Hollywood agency. A few years ago, entertainment analyst Richard Janes told me that, in the not so distant future, he thinks actors will have their three-dimensional likeness scanned, just as a matter of course, on each project for which they are hired. The possibilities are endless; instead of reshoots, a director could simply use AI and an actors scans to redo the scenes in question. You can envision it as an insurance requirement, Janes said. But there are also risks: What happens to the actors scan once theyre done filming? Who owns that? Ripple effects are inevitable. Will awards bodies set requirements dictating what percentage of a performance needs to come from a live human being, unadulterated by AI, in order to be nominated? Maybe well look back on simpler days and think: Remember when performances were created entirely by the actor? The Netflix animated series Bojack Horseman was nothing if not a thorough satire of Hollywood and, the culture writer Haaniyah Angus recently pointed out, the show anticipated this very thing. Sitting in his trailer, Bojack gets 3-D scanned and is casually informed by a producer that one day thats going to be the actors whole job, just sitting in a room for five seconds while a machine scans his face  and then six months later plugging a movie on Kimmel. Bojacks priceless response: I gotta go on Kimmel now, too? Even AI, it seems, cant replace the annoyances of the old fashioned press push. Nina Metz is a Tribune critic nmetz@chicagotribune.com",

ChatGPT Plus will cost $20 per month and will improve the features of the original tool, which will remain free.Those who pay the subscription will get three benefits.  First, they will have access to the chatbot even at peak usage.  The success of the tool has caused it to work poorly during certain hours of the day due to the number of people connecting;  premium users will no longer have to wait for rush hour to pass.Second, subscribers will also get faster service, according to details on its website Open AI, the company that developed the tool.  And, thirdly, they will have access to \"new functions and improvements\" that will gradually be incorporated into the service.  They do not refer to it, but possibly refer to GPT-4, the new version of the AI on which this tool is based.The ChatGPT payment service will only be available to users in the US, although the company plans to add it to new countries in the coming weeks.  Only those who signed up for a waiting list opened by the company a few weeks ago on Discord will have access to this version.We love having non-paying users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT.  The subscription will allow us to contribute so that the free version continues to be available to as many people as possible, the developers point out.The success achieved by ChatGPT among the general public has caused movements in companies.  Microsoft was one of the first to move.  If last week it announced the investment of 10,000 million dollars in OpenAI, of which it was already a partner, to improve the tool, yesterday it revealed that Teams Premium, the paid version of its collaborative work application for companies, will incorporate ChatGPT.This service, available for $7 a month, will allow users to automatically generate meeting notes, personalized presentations and other tasks, such as real-time translations of video call participants.You can follow THE COUNTRY TECHNOLOGY  in  Facebook  Y Twitter  or sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter.\r\n#ChatGPT #powerful #paid #version",

      "description": "A string of mass shootings has reignited debate about addressing gun violence.",
      "body": "Freeman High School in Rockford, Wash.\nRajah Bose for The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\nA string of six mass shootings in California over less than two weeks, which left 30 dead and 19 injured, has reignited calls that the U.S. address gun violence.\nPresident Joe Biden earlier this month pushed for a nationwide ban on assault rifles; while Republicans, who oppose such a measure, have remained largely silent in the aftermath of the attacks. In response to other mass shootings, Republicans have called for improved mental health services.\nThe congressional gridlock and apparent ineffectiveness of California's robust state gun laws have left people searching for alternatives. One relatively new potential solution, the use of artificial intelligence-enhanced security, has drawn interest for its promise of apprehending shooters before a shot is fired.\nMORE: Victims identified in 6th mass shooting in 13 days to rock California\nThe AI security industry touts cameras that identify suspects loitering outside of a school with weapons, high-tech metal detectors that spot hidden guns, and predictive algorithms that analyze information to flag a potential mass shooter.\nCompany officials behind the development of the AI-boosted security cameras say the technology corrects for fallible security officers, who they said often struggle to monitor multiple video feeds and suss out emerging threats. Instead, company officials say, AI reliably identifies assailants as they ready for an attack, saving security officials precious minutes or seconds and possibly saving lives.\n\"This is the best-kept secret,\" Sam Alaimo, co-founder of an AI security company called ZeroEyes, told ABC News. \"If there's an assault rifle outside of a school, people want to know more information. If one life is saved, that's a victory.\"\nCritics, however, question the effectiveness of the products, saying companies have failed to provide independently verified data about accuracy. Even if AI works effectively, they add, the technology raises major concerns over privacy infringement and potential discrimination.\n\"If you're going to trade your privacy and freedom for security, the first question you need to ask is: Are you getting a good deal?\" Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told ABC News.\nThe market for AI security\nAs schools, retailers and offices consider adopting AI security, the industry is poised for growth. The market for products that detect concealed weapons is expected to nearly double from $630 million in 2022 to $1.2 billion by 2031, according to research firm Future Market Insights.\nThe optimism owes in part to the increased prevalence of security cameras, allowing AI companies to sell software that enhances the systems already in use at many buildings.\nAs of the 2017-18 school year, 83% of public schools said they use security cameras, the National Center for Education Statistics found. The figure marked a significant uptick from the 1999-2000 school year, when just 19% of schools were equipped with security cameras, the organization's survey said.\n\"We work with an existing surveillance system,\" Kris Greiner, vice president of sales at AI security company Scylla, told ABC News. \"We just give it a brain.\"\nCompanies working on AI security to prevent shootings\nScylla, an Austin, Texas-based company launched in 2017, offers AI that aids security cameras in not only detecting concealed weapons but also suspicious activity, such as efforts to circumvent security or start a fight, Greiner said.\nWhen the fully automated system identifies a weapon or suspicious actor, it notifies officials at a school or business, he said, noting that mass shooters often draw their gun prior to entering a facility. The system can also be set to immediately deny access and lock doors, he said.\n\"At a time when every second counts, it's quite possible that it would have a heavy impact,\" Greiner said.\nThe company, which has performed about 300 installations across 33 countries, allows client institutions to overcome the common shortcomings of security officers, he added.\nMORE: 11 people hurt in mass shooting in Florida: Police\n\"Imagine a human sitting in a command center watching a video wall, the human can only watch four to five cameras for four to five minutes before he starts missing things,\" Greiner said. \"There's no limit to what an AI can watch.\"\nAnother AI security company, ZeroEyes, offers similar AI-enhanced video monitoring but with a narrower purpose: Gun detection.\nThe company, launched by former Navy Seals in 2018, entered the business after one of its founders realized that security cameras provided evidence to convict mass shooters after the fact but did little to prevent violence in the first place, said Alaimo, ZeroEyes Co-founder.\n\"In the majority of cases, the shooter has a gun exposed before squeezing the trigger,\" Alaimo said. \"We wanted to get an image of that gun and alert first responders with it.\"\nAs with Scylla's product, the ZeroEyes AI tracks live video feeds and sends an alert when it detects a gun. However, the alert at ZeroEyes goes to an internal control room, where company employees determine whether the situation poses a real threat.\n\"We have a human in the loop to make sure the client never gets a false positive,\" Alaimo said, adding that the full process takes as little as three seconds from alert to verification to communication with a client.\nAccuracy in AI security\nAI-enhanced security sounds like a potentially life-saving breakthrough in theory, but the accuracy of the products remains uncertain, said Stanley, of the ACLU. \"If it isn't effective, there's no need to get into a conversation about privacy and security,\" he said. \"The conversation should be over.\"\nMORE: Man who disarmed Monterey Park shooter speaks out: 'Something came over me'\nGreiner, of Scylla, said the company's AI is 99.9% accurate  -- \"with a whole lot of 9s\" -- in identifying weapons, such as guns. But he did not say how accurate the system is in identifying suspicious activity, and said the company has not undergone independent verification of the system's accuracy.\n\"For us to search for a third party to do it -- we haven't done that yet,\" Greiner said, adding that the company allows customers to test the product before purchasing it.\nAlaimo, of ZeroEyes, said the company's use of employee verification as part of its alert process allows for the elimination of false positives. But he declined to say how often the AI system presents employees with false positives or whether employees make mistakes in assessing the alerts.\n\"Transparency is key, because if communities are going to try to make hopefully democratic decisions about whether or not they want these technologies in these public places, they need to know whether it's worth it,\" said Stanley.\nOther concerns about AI\nSetting aside the efficacy of the systems, critics have raised concerns over privacy infringement as well as potential discrimination ena",

      "body": "steadfastly following\nnews about the tech news site CNET quietly running content generated by an AI it won't even name. Even worse, the CNET AI's work quickly turned out to be filled with errors and even plagiarism. (CNET eventually issued corrections on more than half of the bot's 70-odd articles, acknowledging both factual mistakes and \"phrases that were not entirely original.\") And even worse, it later emerged that CNET's leadership knew of the AI's tendency to lie and plagiarize before the deployment, but went ahead and rolled it out anyway.\nRight in the midst of CNET's colossal screwup, a new challenger emerged: BuzzFeed, which said last week that it's going to start using OpenAI's software to generate a new form of its infamous quizzes.\nSome at BuzzFeed were furiously angry about the news, with columnist Max Collins telling the company's CEO Jonah Peretti to \"get fucked.\"\nIndeed, the specter of a slippery slope to further job losses looms heavily over the story. But we have to admit, compared to CNET, BuzzFeed's plan doesn't actually sound that bad.\nFor one thing, the BuzzFeed actually announced its plan ahead of time, instead of slapping a so-tiny-that-literally-nobody-noticed-it-for-two-full-months disclaimer on the AI content, like CNET did. The lack of informed consent in the experiment was a glaring issue with CNET from the jump, so kudos to BuzzFeed for doing better there.\nFor another, at least in theory, BuzzFeed's plan doesn't involve automating away any actual human writers' jobs, like CNET's very clearly did. Instead, the idea is that staffers will dream up clever quizzes into which readers will input specific information, allowing the reader to get a hyper-personalized response. At least in theory, that choose-your-own-adventure style of quiz sounds kind of awesome.\nAnd by the same token, CNET's most extraordinary blunder was letting the bot make factual claims aimed at people looking at real info, which it messed up almost beyond belief. It sounds like BuzzFeed, in contrast, is just having some fun with the tech.\nFor its part, BuzzFeed's leadership seems aware that  at least compared to CNET  it looks pretty thoughtful about the whole thing.\n\"I think that there are two paths for AI in digital media,\" Peretti told CNN of the plan. \"One path is the obvious path that a lot of people will do  but its a depressing path  using the technology for cost savings and spamming out a bunch of SEO articles that are lower quality than what a journalist could do, but a tenth of the cost. Thats one vision, but to me, thats a depressing vision and a shortsighted vision because in the long run its not going to work.\"\nThat said, some BuzzFeed staffers are still nervous, with one expressing anxiety that they'd be the \"first the robot replaces.\"\nThe fear, in other words, is that an experiment in one domain could lead to a much larger program that automates away more and more writing careers.\nA former BuzzFeed staffer said that \"the news sent the smallest shiver down my spine,\" adding that \"I feel badly about the move, and the ethics it comprises, and the new standards it sets for media.\"\nBut BuzzFeed \"has always taken big risks. maybe it knows something we don't about how to infuse AI into copy responsibly,\" they added.\nAs with most other stories to come out of the tech's raucous debut, this one is a mixed bag, and we leave it to the ones who actually work at the affected organizations to lead the discourse about it.\nMore on AI:",

      "body": "A-\nAFP\nParis: Online tools that can create wonderful, absurd and sometimes horrifying images using artificial intelligence (AI) have exploded in popularity, sparking soul-searching over the nature of art.\nTech companies tout their inventions as a liberating force of art for all, but purists argue that the artist is still the central cog in the machine.\nArt historian and AI expert Emily L. Spratt, whose forthcoming book tackles the ethics and regulation of AI art, told AFP that the art world has not yet found a response to the potentially transformative technology.\nAre we all artists now?\nPunch a few keywords into an AI art tool -- something like \"Brad Pitt in a rowing boat in space in the style of Mondrian\" -- and seconds later boldly coloured line drawings will emerge of the Hollywood star, paddling in the stars.\nThere are plenty of fans of tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 who have proclaimed this as the democratisation of art.\nBut Spratt reckons such tools are more about \"entertainment and clickbait\" than art.\n\"It is a way to foster engagement with platforms, which is of course going to help these companies,\" she said.\n\"The idea that it is solely a tool of empowerment or that it will democratise the space is overly simplistic -- it's naive.\"\nRather, she sees the boundary between AI and other technology becoming blurred, pointing to the image manipulation programs already widely used.\n\"I see the future of AI as being part of the omnipresent background architecture for all digital image-making processes,\" she said.\n\"It will be hard to avoid it because it seeps into all of our digital interactions, often unbeknownst to us, especially when we create, edit, or search images.\"\nAre there AI masterpieces?\nBeyond the simple online tools that anyone can use, there are plenty of artists labouring over their own algorithms with bespoke datasets.\nThese works sell for tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands.\nA standout practitioner, said Spratt, is German artist Mario Klingemann whose \"Hyperdimensional Attraction Series, Bestiary\" is a high point of the genre.\n\"It is a video of seemingly organic forms that morph from one physical entity to another and momentarily appear as recognisable animals,\" she said.\n\"Honestly, it's a bit unnerving but it works well as a commentary on the dividing lines between the material and immaterial and the limits of generative AI to replicate the natural world.\"\nShe said his art is constantly asking questions about AI as a medium, and more widely about the nature of Creativity.\nWhat does art world make of AI?\nUntil relatively recently, there was very little buzz around AI outside of video installations, largely because there was no bank of digital images with clear labels.\nWithout the source material, there could be no AI art as we know it today.\nThat changed a decade ago when several projects began to supply huge quantities of digital images, sparking an explosion in Creativity.\nA French collective called Obvious sold a work for more than $400,000 in 2018 after keenly embracing the idea that the AI \"created\" the work.\nThat sale became hugely controversial after it emerged that they had used an algorithm written by artist and programmer Robbie Barrat.\n\"The reason that the Obvious artwork sold, especially at that price, was largely because it was advertised as the first AI artwork to be offered at a major auction house,\" said Spratt.\n\"It was really the art market experimenting with the offering of an AI artwork in step with long-established approaches to the sale of fine art.\"\nAt that moment, she said, there was huge interest in bringing together the tech sector and the art world.\nBut the tech industry has since been hit by a dramatic economic slump and investment and interest have waned.\nMajor auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have since worked hard to create separate platforms for selling AI art.\n\"It's like they don't want to sully fine art with these new digital explorations,\" Spratt said.\nAnd critics are yet to catch up with the field and really express what is good, bad or indifferent, she reckoned.\n\"Unfortunately, the AI art discourse is not there yet, but I think it is on its way, and it should come from the field of art history,\" she insisted.",

      "body": "How Brands and Agencies Are Experimenting With ChatGPT From Copywriting to Chatbots\nA test and learn strategy for everyone\nProduct uses the technology to test creative imagery at scale. A so-called test and learn strategy can save clients money and increase their ROI. A lot goes into creating assets like this that only flop upon activation. Assume that a brand invests hundreds of thousands of dollars creating an arsenal of ads with blue backgrounds, only to find that once theyve activated the media, they find that the target audience just doesnt like the color blue.\nFor most agencies, practical limitations leave little room for agencies to truly test, learn and alter their campaigns in real time. Agencies often work in silos, and this combined with low bandwidth, makes it tough to match the right creative assets with the right audience and optimize that creative depending on the audiences engagement, or lack thereof.\nBut AI-generated work has the potential to change this, according to Shapiro, assuming that agencies use AI to produce low-fidelity versions of an ad and activate that creative on social platforms to small subsets of a large target audience.\nYou could test right away to see if messages work, Shapiro said. And not only that, you could do this for dozens and dozens of derivatives of conceptstesting color, style, images, types of text, tonality, whether it should be a live image or an illustration, he added.\nOne large consumer company tapped the agency to help it launch a product. Before the product ever launched, the agency used AI to auto-generate a catalog of messages and evaluate their effectiveness. After testing the messaging with a small audience, it discovered what resonated most with the brands target audiences. That allowed us to do a full launch with pre-vetted messaging, Shapiro said.\nA test and learn media strategy is not a novelty on its own. For example, VaynerMedia executes this strategy, which it calls its Vayner Volume Model. But executing a similar strategy is daunting, if not impossible for many agencies that dont have a similarly deep expertise in social media or an integrated creative team on hand to mass-produce different variations of creative assets.\nNow, testing out creative concepts en masse is one of Products core service offerings. Earlier this month it launched its AI Studio, overseen by Tim Nolan, the agencys product partner and executive creative director. In a statement, Nolan said he refers to tools like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and ChatGPT as his junior team. In fact, every project the agency works on is supported by AI to some degree, its leader told Adweek. Its just part of the process in which we produce work, he said.\nWhen used to support a campaign strategy, the technology can cut down the hours creatives spend sketching a concept or hunting down stock photography that illustrates it. Now, they can use generative AI to almost instantaneously produce images that represent their ideas.\nThe opportunity looks different for holding companies\nLiu, whose role at Carat revolves around educating clients on the latest technology trends, described AI as ramping back up again, following ChatGPTs mainstream availability.\nAbout 75% of Dentsu Media have approached Liu with questions about the technology. He plans to spend the next three to six months educating those clients ahead of those brands taking action. Conversations taking place at Lius level revolve around to what extent AI-generated creative will be consumer facing versus a behind-the-scenes boon to campaign strategy.\nWhen we pivot into this big crescendo of generative AI, from text-to-image and image-to-image based AI, a lot of our clients are [wondering], Can this change our workflow of building creative? Liu said.\nBut Lius clients are only beginning to understand what the technology can offer, he added. Meanwhile, Dentsu is building its knowledge, with media and creative work streams converging. Liu is having frequent conversations with his innovation counterpart at Dentsu Creative, foreshadowing how large networks must rally to establish generative AI strategies that reach all sides of the house.\nRegardless of how agencies use the technology right now, its inherent flexibility makes it a worthwhile addition to creative workflows.\nThose [agencies] who have specialists on their teams that understand how to utilize these platforms as this toolbox, or something that can help augment your workflow, will greatly have an advantage over those who dont, Liu said.\nEnjoying Adweek's Content?

      "body": "Twitter\nIllustration by Zaire Diaz/The Daily Campus\nOn Feb. 1, the Writing Center organized an event to talk about teaching in the age of ChatGPT, the natural language model that has taken the mainstream by storm. Over 200 people attended the event, which was sponsored by the Humanities Institutes Digital Humanities and Media Studies Initiative, the Writing Center and the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. Professors gathered to discuss urgent concerns about course policies, practices and ethics in the era of ChatGPT. They also posed philosophical questions discussing ChatGPTs implications for thinking and language, teaching and learning and the purposes of higher education.\nProfessors shared their experiences adapting to ChatGPT in the classroom and their opinions on its use.\nProfessors at the discussion had varying views on whether or not students should be allowed to use ChatGPT in their assignments.\nAs an English professor, Yohei Igarashi does not discourage his students from utilizing ChatGPT in his class. Instead, he tells his students that they need to cite it.\nIf you dont acknowledge it, Im going to consider it plagiarism in the same way that I would if you dont acknowledge sources, Igarashi said. But I didnt prohibit them or discourage them from using it.\nIgarashi said that the problem of trying to coax original thoughts out of students has been a problem since the internet and pointed out that professors have always been able to adapt.\nI think teachers are really good at coming up with assignments that facilitate that, Igarashi said. A lot of the things we already do to make our assignments very specific still work for now with large language models and text generators like ChatGPT.\nProfessors also raised concerns about determining the boundary between utilizing ChatGPT as a tool and exploiting it for plagiarism, acknowledging that students can use it for more than just generating writing.\nSome professors are okay with students using ChatGPT as an assignment tool.\nKyle Booten, an English professor using ChatGPT as a tool for his book, hoped that ChatGPT would not be solely known to students as the thing that writes your paper for you. Instead, he and many other professors at the event expressed a desire for more people to recognize the capabilities and potential of ChatGPT.\nIt can also make writing more challenging in different ways, catalyze your thinking in ways that are unique to it, and I think theres a lot of opportunity to figure out what those ways are, Booten said.\nAlexandra Paxton, a psychology professor, believes it is a great tool to help students draft their ideas.\nAs long as theyre authentically speaking and theyre putting the intellectual effort on their own, Im fine with that, Paxton said. I want them to be sparked and interested to invest in the assignment and invest in their own ideas and thinking about their own lives, and thats not something ChatGPT can do for them.\nHowever, some professors are afraid that students would use ChatGPT to generate ideas instead of thinking for themselves.\nI think a lot of the panic is not about the particular word choices. Its that at least some students are going to use it to generate the ideas, which is the whole point of the learning exercise, Michael Morrell, a political science professor, said. Acknowledgement is not enough; I want them to at least try to do these ideas on their own.\nThere was also discussion about how bias in AI can force dominant writing styles onto marginalized people, who are usually oppressed in their writing, according to Paxton.\nIn using this as proofreading, in using this as a generator, are we whitening, masculating our voices so that people dont have authenticity? Paxton asked. How are we excluding voices from our communications and implicitly allowing undergraduates to have their own voices and authenticity removed?\nShe says that these marginalized groups may not be represented in the data that these AI models are trained on.\nThere is not equity and access to the sorts of materials that then create the data sets that are then used to create the models, Paxton said.\nOn the other hand, professor Arash Zaghi uses ChatGPT as an assistive technology for neurodiverse learners.\nThink about it as 24/7 writing assistance at their disposal, Zaghi said.\nThe event allowed for virtual or in-person attendance at the Homer Babbidge Library.\nTAGS",

The joint work will apply AI foundation model technology to NASA's Earth-observing satellite data for the first time, NASA said in a statement.\nFoundation models are types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabelled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another.\n\"The beauty of foundation models is they can potentially be used for many downstream applications,\" said Rahul Ramachandran, a senior research scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\"Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams; you need teams across different organisations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets,\" Ramachandran said in a statement.\nOne project will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites, the statement said.\nBy analysing satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields, and wildlife habitats, this model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planet's environmental systems.\nAnother output from this collaboration is expected to be an easily searchable corpus of Earth science literature.\nIBM has developed a natural language processing (NLP) model trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organise the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge, the company said.\nBeyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science could be infused into NASA's scientific data management and stewardship processes.\nDont miss out on ET Prime stories!

      "description": "How powerful new technologies transform economies",
      "body": "It can take a little imagination to see how some innovations might change an economy. Not so with the latest ai tools. It is easyfrom a writers perspective, uncomfortably soto think of contexts in which something like Chatgpt, a clever chatbot which has taken the web by storm since its release in November, could either dramatically boost a human workers productivity or replace them outright. The gpt in its name stands for generative pre-trained transformer, which is a particular kind of language model. It might well stand for general-purpose technology: an earth-shaking sort of innovation which stands to boost productivity across a wide-range of industries and occupations, in the manner of steam engines, electricity and computing. The economic revolutions powered by those earlier gpts can give us some idea how powerful ai might transform economies in the years ahead.\nIn a paper published in 1995, Timothy Bresnahan of Stanford University and Manuel Trajtenberg of Tel Aviv University set out what they saw as the characteristics of a general-purpose technology. It must be used in many industries, have an inherent potential for continued improvement and give rise to innovational complementaritiesthat is, induce knock-on innovation in the industries which use it. ai is being adopted widely, seems to get better by the day and is being deployed in ever more r&d contexts. So when does the economic revolution begin?\nThe first lesson from history is that even the most powerful new tech takes time to change an economy. James Watt patented his steam engine in 1769, but steam power did not overtake water as a source of industrial horsepower until the 1830s in Britain and 1860s in America. In Britain the contribution of steam to productivity growth peaked post-1850, nearly a century after Watts patent, according to Nicholas Crafts of the University of Sussex. In the case of electrification, the key technical advances had all been accomplished before 1880, but American productivity growth actually slowed from 1888 to 1907. Nearly three decades after the first silicon integrated circuits Robert Solow, a Nobel-prizewinning economist, was still observing that the computer age could be seen everywhere but in the productivity statistics. It was not until the mid-1990s that a computer-powered productivity boom eventually emerged in America. \nThe gap between innovation and economic impact is in part because of fine-tuning. Early steam engines were wildly inefficient and consumed prohibitively expensive piles of coal. Similarly, the stunning performance of recent ai tools represents a big improvement over those which sparked a boomlet of ai enthusiasm roughly a decade ago. (Siri, Apples virtual assistant, was released in 2011, for example.) Capital constraints can also slow deployment. Robert Allen of New York University Abu Dhabi argues that the languid rise in productivity growth in industrialising Britain reflected a lack of capital to build plants and machines, which was gradually overcome as capitalists reinvested their fat profits.  \nMore recent work emphasises the time required to accumulate what is known as intangible capital, or the basic know-how needed to make effective use of new tech. Indeed, Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University, Daniel Rock of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chad Syverson of the University of Chicago suggest a disruptive new technology may be associated with a productivity J-curve. Measured productivity growth may actually decline in the years or decades after a new technology appears, as firms and workers divert time and resources to studying the tech and designing business processes around it. Only later as these investments bear fruit does the J surge upward. The authors reckon that ai-related investments in intangible capital may already be depressing productivity growth, albeit not yet by very much. \nOf course for many people, questions about the effects of ai on growth take a back seat to concerns about consequences for workers. Here, historys messages are mixed. There is good news: despite epochal technological and economic change, fears of mass technological unemployment have never before been realised. Tech can and does take a toll on individual occupations, however, in ways that can prove socially disruptive. Early in the Industrial Revolution, mechanisation dramatically increased demand for relatively unskilled workers, but crushed the earnings of craftsmen who had done much of the work before, which is why some chose to join machine-smashing Luddite movements. And in the 1980s and 1990s, automation of routine work on factory floors and in offices displaced many workers of modest means, while boosting employment for both high- and low-skilled workers.  \nGee, Pretty Terrific\nai might well augment the productivity of workers of all different skill levels, even writers. Yet what that means for an occupation as a whole depends on whether improved productivity and lower costs lead to a big jump in demand or only a minor one. When the assembly linea process innovation with gpt-like characteristicsallowed Henry Ford to cut the cost of making cars, demand surged and workers benefited. If ai boosts productivity and lowers costs in medicine, for example, that might lead to much higher demand for medical services and professionals. \nThere is a chance that powerful ai will break the historic mould. A technology capable of handling almost any task the typical person can do would bring humanity into uncharted economic territory. Yet even in such a scenario, the past holds some lessons. The sustained economic growth which accompanied the steam revolution, and the further acceleration which came along with electrification and other later innovations, were themselves unprecedented. They prompted a tremendous scramble to invent new ideas and institutions, to make sure that radical economic change translated into broad-based prosperity rather than chaos. It may soon be time to scramble once again. \nRead more from Free Exchange, our column on economics:\nHave economists misunderstood inflation?

      "description": "Unless youve spent your summer on a digital detox, youve probably heard of ChatGPT: the latest AI chatbot taking the world by storm.",
      "body": "January 22, 2023\nBut theres yet another question ChatGPT has thrown up: that is, whether ChatGPT could be considered an academic author.\nIt might seem far-fetched, but several papers published recently have listed ChatGPT as an author, including an editorial published in the journal Nurse Education in Practice.\nLast year, some researchers also tried to list GPT-3 as an author on a paper it wrote about itself  but they struggled with listing the authors telephone number and email, and had to ask GPT-3 if it had conflicts of interest.\nThe issue of AI authorship is now clearly on the minds of commercial academic publishers. Last week, both the Science and Nature journals declared their positions on the use of ChatGPT to generate articles.\nScience is updating its license and editorial policies to specify that text generated by ChatGPT (or any other AI tools) cannot be used in the work, nor can figures, images, or graphics be the products of such tools.\nADVERTISEMENT\nprinciples\n:\nNo LLM (large language model) tool will be accepted as a credited author on a research paper. That is because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility\nResearchers using LLM tools should document this use in the methods or acknowledgements sections. If a paper does not include these sections, the introduction or another appropriate section can be used to document the use of the LLM.\nThese are drastic steps which highlight a fast-moving issue. But why does it matter whether or not ChatGPT can author an academic paper?\nAuthorship: the currency of the academic realm\nTo understand this, its important to first understand that authorship in academia isnt the same as authorship of, say, a newspaper article.\nThats because researchers are not paid to publish papers. Theyre rewarded through successful grant applications, or through promotion, for the number of times theyre listed as an author on an academic paper (and especially if the paper is published in a prestigious journal).\nIn the academic world, authorship doesnt necessarily mean having actually written the paper  but it should, ideally, reflect genuine involvement in the research process.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCONTINUE READING BELOW\nIt also conveys responsibility for the contents of the paper. The 2018 Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research includes a guide on authorship which states:\nAll listed authors are collectively accountable for the whole research output. An individual author is directly responsible for the accuracy and integrity of their contribution to the output.\nThis raises the question: can an AI tool be held responsible for the content it produces? As an extreme example, if ChatGPTs contribution to a paper included an error that led to people dying, who would be held accountable?\nTheres also author order to consider. In most areas of research, the first-listed author is considered the lead author. Other disciplines have their own acknowledgement systems, which can include alphabetical listing.\nBut ChatGPT doesnt derive any career benefit from authorship, so where would that contribution sit within the relevant author order?\nCopyright issues\nThen there is the issue of copyright. Commercial academic publishing is a hugely profitable business that relies on authors signing over copyright to the publisher.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCONTINUE READING BELOW\nThis is a commercial arrangement. The author retains their moral right to be listed as an author and to take responsibility for their work, while the publisher charges for access to it.\nThe question of whether an AI program can own copyright is being debated. Copyright differs across the world, but traditionally has required a human to generate the work.\nThere are echoes here of a US case in which it was debated whether a monkey who took a selfie could own copyright of the image. The decision was it could not.\nBrave new world\nTheres clearly a great deal of work that will need to happen to understand how AI tools will exist in our lives in the future.\nChatGPT isnt going anywhere. Even if its banned from being acknowledged as an academic author, theres nothing to stop researchers using it in their research process. The academic community will need guidelines on how to manage this.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCONTINUE READING BELOW\nThere are interesting parallels here with the open access movement. Many discussions about ChatGPT in educational settings point to a need to move away from the traditional essay as assessment, and instead concentrate on marking students for showing their work.\nWe could see something similar in academia, where each aspect of the research is made openly available, with acknowledgement of the originator, including ChatGPT. Not only would this increase transparency, it would also reduce the over-reliance on authorship as a primary mechanism for rewarding researchers.\nWhere authorship is failing\nBecause of the value of having ones name on a paper, there has long been a concept of gift or honorary authorship.\nThis is where a persons name is added to the author list even if they didnt contribute to the paper. They may have been the person who obtained the research grant, or may have simply been added because they have a high profile and could increase the chances of the paper being published.\nTwo recent studies, one in Europe and one in Australia, reveal the level of pressure PhD and early-career researchers are under to provide gift authorship. This supervisory pressure reflects whats happening at a larger scale.\nADVERTISEMENT",

      "body": "privacy notice\nAlmost 600 drivers in Devon and Cornwall were detected not wearing seatbelts by a camera system which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to capture offences.\nDevon & Cornwall Police hosted a pioneering trial of the Aecom technology, which uses cameras to capture images of seatbelt and mobile phone offences, towards the end of last year. The news comes as the UK marks the 40th anniversary of the introduction of seatbelt laws.The results of the trial have been released by the Vision Zero South West road safety partnership, who funded the trial of the ground-breaking Aecom system. In total, 590 drivers were detected not wearing seatbelts at various locations across Devon and Cornwall during the 15-day trial period.\nExample images from the Aecom camera system showing drivers and passengers not wearing seatbelts\n(\nThis included major routes such as the A30 and A38.Of the drivers detected:\n 162 have opted to undertake an educational driver training course\n 61 have paid a fixed penalty fine\n 298 cases are having files prepared for court for the offence of failing to identify a driver\n Investigations are ongoing in 29 cases where the registered keeper has nominated a new named driver.\nA small number of drivers were found to be exempt from wearing a seatbelt due to certain medical conditions or specific commercial exemptions.\nDuring the trial the camera system detected between 0.5 and 22 seatbelt offences per hour across the various locations. The worst sites were Sidmouth Road in Exeter, where offences were detected in 2% of all traffic monitored, and Embankment Road in Plymouth, which had a detection rate of 22 seatbelt offences per hour.\nThe Aecom technology also detected 45 mobile phone offences during its deployment.Adrian Leisk is Devon and Cornwall Polices Head of Road Safety and chair of the Vision Zero South West enforcement group.\nExample images from the Aecom camera system showing drivers and passengers not wearing seatbelts\n(\n)\nMr Leisk said: These results are really worrying. Most people put on their seatbelt without even thinking about it whenever they get in their car  so its amazing that 40 years since it became compulsory to wear them, there are still hundreds in the South West who refuse to do so.\nLast year we saw numerous serious collisions in which drivers and passengers not wearing seatbelts were killed or seriously injured.\nWe know that wearing a seat belt reduces the risk of death for drivers in a road collision by around 50%. Yet almost a third of the people who died in UK car collisions in 2021 were not wearing a seat belt  the highest level recorded since recent records began.\nPlease, please make sure you buckle up before every trip  no matter the distance.\nPolice car with VZ logo\n(",

      "body": "\nAsbury Park Press\nWhen Meredith Heeters English classes sat down to write essays last month on Lord of the Flies, the laptops were put away, the cell phones turned off, and pen and paper were the only tools allowed.\nThats because the 22-year veteran teacher at Manasquan High School wanted to avoid any chance her senior students might utilize AI, or artificial intelligence, the growing online option that can theoretically write assignments for students.\nI felt like getting rid of the temptation to use that technology, said Heeter, who said at least one colleague in her department is following a similar approach. It is an interesting tool and this way I had more control over the authenticity of their work.\nHeeter is among hundreds of Shore educators who are reacting to what one top administrator called the explosion of AI, which other school leaders describe as worrisome and concerning.\nMore:\nHere's how more than 400 NJ school districts ranked on state Student Learning Assessments\nWhile some contend the new technology can be used productively for todays tech-savvy pupils, most are offering uncertainty as the option grows in popularity.\nStudent use of AI to complete their work is a worrisome prospect, said Charles Sampson, superintendent of the Freehold Regional High School District, which serves more than 10,000 students in six high schools. But with the technology itself, there could also be positive opportunities. Time will tell.\nBrick Township Superintendent Thomas G. Farrell offered a similar view.\nIt is very interesting yet very concerning at the same time, Farrell said via email. This will be an arduous task for teachers to develop assignments   so that simple online plagiarism can't come into play.\nThe most popular AI program is ChatGPT, a free artificial intelligence computer program that writes human-sounding answers to most questions and can produce 500-word essays explaining anything from quantum physics to plotlines of The Grapes of Wrath.\nIn the past, AI has been used largely for predictions or categorization, said Helen Lee Bouygues, president and founder of the\nReboot Foundation\n, which advocates for critical thinking to combat the rise of misinformation. ChatGPT will actually create new articles, news items or blog posts, even school essays, and its pretty hard to distinguish between them and real, human-created writing,\nMichael Citta, superintendent of Toms River Regional Schools  the Shores largest district  admitted that countering the AI programs takes more than plagiaristic reviews.\nIt seems, unfortunately, that technology and methods through which to take educational shortcuts  and the children that such tech targets  will always be 10 steps ahead of any potential response or circumvention, he said via email.\nMore:\nOpenAI\n. Its a free online tool using millions of pages of Internet writing.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company \"made ChatGPT available as a research preview to learn from real-world use, which we believe is a critical part of developing and deploying capable, safe AI systems.\"\nThe growing online option is sparking mixed reviews nationwide, with New York City and Los Angeles public schools barring ChatGPTs use.\nWhen this came out in the fall, I did hear some people who were panicking that this is the end of the essay, said Anna Muessig, associate director for professional development and instructional issues at the New Jersey Education Association, which represents thousands of state teachers. There could be drawbacks and places where a student takes the shortcut.\nBut most Monmouth and Ocean county schools are still reviewing the AI programs, with few indicating any immediate policy changes or restrictions.\nThose who spoke with the Asbury Park Press contend the technology is here to stay and needs to be utilized in positive ways if possible.\nSeveral educators compared the initial fears with similar concerns that arose when previous technologies, from calculators to search engines, convinced some that education would be seriously affected.\nI just honestly heard about ChatGPT two weeks ago or so and now I am hearing about it everywhere, said Joseph Howe, superintendent  of the Freehold Borough School District. These same concerns arose during the proliferation of Google and Wikipedia and I suspect students will learn how to use AI programs to enhance their learning the same way they have learned how to use these other tools.\nJames Stefankiewicz, superintendent of the Ocean Township School District, offered concerns, but with optimism.\nWe understand how this could be used by students in a way that is not with the best intentions, but when things like this come out we should work to embrace and utilize in our programs for both students and staff, he said.\nBack in Manasquan, Meredith Heeter said her students did well on the in-class, hand-written essay, as well as another mid-term assignment covering a string of reading assignments.\nI think I got a better product the second time, she said. They had to pay better attention.\nJoe Strupp is an award-winning journalist with 30 years experience who covers education and several local communities for APP.com and the Asbury Park Press.

      "body": "\"Both countries could face catastrophe.\"\nAIrms Race\nThe US-China AI arms race is here, with both international powers vying for ultimate power over the rapidly growing  and increasingly impressive  tech. But according to one Harvard researcher, if we don't put a lid on the competition soon, civilization as we know it could end up paying a hefty price.\n\"This competition comes with huge risks,\"\nWill Henshall, a graduate researcher studying public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, wrote for The Boston Globe.\n\"If the United States and China don't find ways to reduce these risks, both countries could face catastrophe.\"\nMcSteamy\nHenshall's argument frames AI as the next game-changing general-purpose technology, and as with other general-purpose breakthroughs previously, countries will do whatever they can to establish dominance over it. In this case, as nations worldwide seek to incorporate AI further into advanced weapons, that means spending a lot of military money.\n\"In fiscal year 2021, the US government spent $10.8 billion on AI R&D, $9.3 billion of which came from the Department of Defense,\" writes Henshall, meanwhile noting that the\nUS has also been movin\ng to make necessary AI-building resources like computer chips more difficult for China to get its hands on, seemingly in a means to stifle the competition. \"Chinese public expenditure on AI is less transparent, but analysts estimate that it is roughly comparable.\"\nWithin the context of the broader general-tech history, this is normal behavior. New inventions have always powered nations and their economies, and world powers move quickly to make sure that they reap the lion's share of the rewards, be they economic, defensive, or as in this case both.\nBut AI could be radically different. A steam engine, the researcher's preferred foil to the threat of AI, goes from point A to B. Sure, it could crash, but not even a fleet of steam engines could unintentionally destroy entire nations, let alone civilization as a whole.\nAI, at least in thought experiments like the paperclip problem, very well could. And right now, we just don't know enough about it to confidently prevent that from happening  especially in an environment where competition trumps cooperation, a system that inherently favors power and speed over precaution.\nAnd when it comes to technology this powerful  technology that again, we don't really even understand yet  prioritizing precaution seems more than necessary. Perhaps, as Henshall argues, for the sake of us all.\nREAD MORE: The steam engine changed the world. Artificial intelligence could destroy it. [The Boston Globe]\nMore on doomsday AI:",

      "description": "Staff at Google are currently testing an in-house AI chatbot known as Apprentice Bard that responds similarly to ChatGPT. This could potentially be Google's response to the rise of OpenAI's creation.",
      "body": "Google, the biggest search engine in the world, seems to be taken aback by OpenAIs revolutionary creation ChatGPT. According to a recent report by CNBC, the Alphabet-owned company is reportedly asking its staff to work towards creating test potential alternatives to ChatGPT. The launch of OpenAIs chatbot ChatGPT went on to gain over one million users in just five days since its launch on November 30 last year largely due to its impressive human-like responses to queries. In the process it spooked a lot of tech giants already working in the space. The AI-backed chatbot also prompted the tech world to brainstorm over multitudes of use cases that could eventually make several tasks easier and keep them abreast with the latest innovation. What is Apprentice Bard? Staff at Google are testing an in-house AI chatbot known as Apprentice Bard that responds similarly to ChatGPT. Googles ChatBot is built on its LaMDA technology which is similar to OpenAIs GPT series of language models that supports ChatGPT. LaMDA (or Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a conversation technology that was developed by Google Research in 2017. In case you are wondering, yes, it is the same LaMDA that a Google engineer thought had gone sentient. Reports suggest Google has asked its LaMDA team to prioritise its work to respond to the rise of ChatGPT. Googles Apprentice Bard reportedly looks similar to ChatGPT. The staff can enter their queries in the dialog box and the ChatBot will respond, they can also give their feedback on the same. Apprentice Bard Vs ChatGPT The most apparent distinction between Apprentice Bard and ChatGPT is the formers ability to integrate recent events into its responses. On the other hand, OpenAI has on numerous occasions stated that ChatGPT has limited knowledge of its surroundings and events after 2021. Interestingly, the report demonstrated Bards familiarity with current affairs by sharing its response to a query on Googles recent layoffs. According to CNBC, one of the testers asked Apprentice Bard if there will be another round of layoffs at Google. The Bard responded to the query by saying, According to my database access, it is unlikely for Google to conduct another round of layoffs in 2023 Layoffs are generally conducted to reduce costs and structure, but the company is doing well financially. In fact, Googles revenue increased by 34% in 2021, and the companys stock price has risen by 70% since January 2022. Reports also suggest that Google has replaced its smart chatbot Meena with Apprentice Bard. Google staff is said to have noticed Bards responses becoming more comprehensive and accurate over the last few weeks. ChatGPT-like homepage for Google The same report has also indicated that Google has been testing alternative versions of its homepage. Much similar to the homepage of ChatGPT, one of the Google Homepages offers potential question prompts in place of the Im feeling lucky tab under the search bar. The homepage being tested also displayed a chat logo at the right corner of the search bar. When a user enters a query, the results appear in a gray bubble under the search bar. This time with more human-like answers than the usual Google Search results. Under the results, users will also get suggestions for several follow-up questions related to their first question. While Google has been aggressively working towards integrating its own ChatGPT-like AI chatbot in its products, the timeline of these innovations remains unclear. However, one thing that is clear in all this is that Google has upped its ante against the proliferation of ChatGPT.",

Things got even more embarrassing for the site when Futurism discovered that the bot's articles were loaded with errors and plagiarism.\nNow, according to new reporting from The Verge, the scandal has deepened considerably: leadership at CNET's parent company, Red Ventures, was fully aware that the deeply flawed AI had a habit of fabricating facts and plagiarizing others' work  and deployed it anyway.\n\"They were well aware of the fact that the AI plagiarized and hallucinated,\" a source who attended a meeting about the AI's substantial shortcomings at Red Ventures told The Verge.\n\"One of the things they were focused on when they developed the program was reducing plagiarism,\" the source added. \"I suppose that didnt work out so well.\"\nThat claim adds a dark new layer to the deepening storm cloud over CNET and the rest of Red Ventures' portfolio, which includes the finance sites Bankrate and CreditCards.com, as well as an armada of education and health sites including Healthline.\nIt'd be bad, of course, to roll out a busted AI that churned out SEO bait financial articles that needed corrections so extensive that more than half of them now carry an editor's note.\nBut the idea that Red Ventures knew that the AI was broken in advance, discussed the issue in staff meetings, and then chose to deploy it anyway? That's a whole new low, and a cautionary tale about how profit-greedy companies are likely to roll out unfinished AI tech in the media and far beyond.\nCNET didn't respond to a request for comment about the new allegations.\nAre you a current or former Red Ventures employee with information about the company's use of AI? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.\nThe revelation also sheds new perspective on CNET editor-in-chief Connie Guglielmo's strident defense of the bot after its errors and plagiarism were outed.\n\"Expect CNET to continue exploring and testing how AI can be used to help our teams as they go about their work testing, researching and crafting the unbiased advice and fact-based reporting were known for,\" Guglielmo wrote.\nGuglielmo has not responded to the new allegations.\nNew allegations surfaced by The Verge suggest that CNET's fall from integrity has been more profound than previously known, even beyond its use of AI.\nMultiple former employees told the outlet in its new reporting that there were multiple times when they were pressured to edit stories and reviews so that they would be more favorable to the company's advertisers.\n\"I understood a supervisor to imply in conversation that how I proceeded with my review could impact my chances of promotion in the future,\" one source told The Verge.\nAnd anyone at the company who opposes CNET's pivot to wretchedly low quality AI and undisclosed advertiser influence of coverage? They're getting shown the door.\n\"Its a culture that if you disagree with them, theyre going to get rid of you and replace you with a zealot,\" another former employee told The Verge. \"Somebody thats absolutely a true believer, [that] drinks the Kool-Aid.\"\nMore on CNET:",

Supreme Court lawyer and cybersecurity expert Pavan Duggal had earlier said AI was coming to India in a big way and the country needs to pull up its socks in preparation.\nAI Crimes\nAccording to researchers, if AI falls into wrong hands, there are several ways the technology could be misused to trigger targeted phishing attacks, new stalking techniques and also deepfakes.\nUniversity College of London has compiled a list of 20 potential AI-enabled crimes based on academic papers, news and popular culture. This includes threats like fake audio or video to discredit public figures or influence public opinion, extorting money and impersonating a family member.\nFor example, ElevenLabs, a speech AI firm, recently unveiled a beta version of its platform that enables users to clone someones voice or develop totally new synthetic voices for text-to-speech audio. However, the company said on Twitter that it is observing a growing number of voice cloning misuse cases and is considering implementing additional protections\" as a solution to the issue.\nReports suggest that there are videos posted online with produced voices that resemble famous people reading or saying inappropriate things. Now imagine this in the Indian context  what happens if such technology is used in a country of our proportions by people with wrong intent?\nMany online users still become victims of fake news every day. It will just be a matter of time before they start a brawl on social media after watching a deepfake video on a controversial matter and take it to the streets.\nCan We Move Ahead?\nAs the government focuses on AI adoption, which was clear during the Budget announcement and MoS Rajeev Chandrasekhars recent statement on inclusion of the technology, News18.com spoke to Anushkaa Arora, Principal Founder of ABA Law Office, to understand the AI challenges in India.\nThe legal expert said it would be incorrect to state that India lacks AI-specific laws, despite the fact that many nations around the world are developing such legal framework. She explained that there are laws in India that specifically address cybercrimes, such as the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Indian Penal Code 1860, but yes, there is no specific legislation in India for AI.\nArora agreed that it would be better to have a full-fledged legal framework dealing with AI first and thereafter progress in developing the same in order to avoid AI-related crimes.\nI believe that first having a check is important because currently, India is facing lots of cybercrime-related issues. Every now and then, individuals/companies are falling prey to the same and individuals along with cyber police are unaware of the integrities involved, she added.\nThe expert said since the Union Budget is targeting something big, there must be a fool-proof legal framework with respect to AI. She suggested extensive training for police officials and sensitisation programmes for the citizens at large.\nIf India enters into a massive AI platform as announced in the Union Budget with correct legal framework and further activities as suggested, this shall open floodgates to cybercrimes and worse, noted Arora.\nRead all the Latest India News here\nAbout the Author",

      "body": "The latest Cyberpunk 2077 patch added DLSS 3 to the title. The new temporal upscaling technology adds frame generation and super resolution to the game, which according to Nvidia, sets the platform for the upcoming RT: Overdrive mode.The update is now available for download, and the feature has been integrated without major flaws or bugs destroying the experience.DLSS 3 has been added to multiple titles fairly quickly. Earlier at CES, Nvidia announced that over 50 games already support the feature, with more titles in the pipeline. The company even called DLSS 3 its fastest mass-adopted technology to date. More details about Cyberpunk 2077's DLSS 3 mode and performance gainsPerformance metrics with various Nvidia RTX video cards in Cyberpunk 2077 (Image via Nvidia)According to Nvidia, the new version of DLSS is a frame multiplier. The technology uses AI to insert frames between the two generated by the graphics card. This effectively increases the framerate by two to three times, depending on the intensity of the game.The technology takes the load off the graphics card and CPU. This frees up computing power, resulting in a lower power draw. In our testing, we found surprising results in Cyberpunk, a game that ranks among the most intense titles on the market.Commenting on the integration of the technology into the game, Jakub Knapik, Global Art Director at CD Projekt Red, said:Playing Cyberpunk 2077 with the AI-powered performance of NVIDIA DLSS 3 is the best way to access the stunning visuals the game has to offer  this technology helps us take a new step toward combining unconstrained visual fidelity with exceptional performance.Performance gainsIn our testing, we used the flagship RTX 4090 GPU from Nvidia. The card is the best option for 4K gaming at high refresh rates. However, in Cyberpunk, it barely hits 30 FPS at native resolution without upscaling.With DLSS 2 enabled, the card could hit 70 FPS. However, noticeable shimmering and texture were popping, and the experience was not close to ideal.However, with the latest technology applied, the card could deliver over 120 FPS in the game, a testimony to the technological marvel of DLSS 3.It is worth noting that DLSS Super Resolution (DSR) is an improved version of AI upscaling, the technology on which DLSS 2 relies. With just DSR applied, the game looked noticeably better, with almost a similar performance increase.Interesting power consumption trends were spotted in Cyberpunk 2077With DLSS 3 applied, other anomalies were spotted in system usage. The RTX 4090 drew significantly less power while delivering almost four times higher framerates.The power consumption characteristics are plotted in the interactive graph below. At native resolution, the RTX 4090 consumed close to 400 W.However, with DLSS frame generation and Super Resolution applied, the power draw fell to less than 300 W, making the card much more power efficient.Thus, the addition of the latest temporal upscaling technologies is a win-win for both the experience and efficiency of the system. Notably, Cyberpunk 2077 comes off as one of the most power-hungry and demanding games on the market.The addition of the latest upscaling technologies opens up a new dimension in Cyberpunk 2077. The game hits over 4K 120 FPS with almost no noticeable changes in visual quality.",
