{"summary_text":" NVIDIA Eye Contact uses artificial intelligence to replace your eyes with \"simulated\" ones that are positioned in front of your camera. When you're not actually making eye contact with the camera, the AI-powered feature makes it look like you are. Eye Contact is intended for creators who want to look directly into the camera at all times, even if they have to glance away from the action."},
{"summary_text":"A rumor has surfaced about NVIDIA RTX 4090 Ti specifications. The card will feature a stripped-down AD102 GPU with 18,176 cores (1,792 more than the RTX 4090) memory upgraded to 24Gbps and a TBP of 600W. This is the maximum power for a single conductor of 16. Final Fantasy 16 is in the \"final stages of development\""},
{"summary_text":"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wants to blend, analyze and centralize the huge volumes of information it receives. Lockheed Martin and NVIDIA are teaming up to create a digital replica of the earth based on data from around the globe and space. The data will be converted into a visual image using a process called Universal Scene Description."},
{"summary_text":"A recent shipping manifest might be our first hint that NVIDIA is indeed working on a brand new Titan RTX graphics card featuring the Ada architecture. The shipping manifests can be seen listed at Volza which tracks global import data and has various containers of the \"PG137-0000\" GPUs (prototypes) heading out from the United States to India for further testing & validation."},
{"summary_text":"Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ:HST) scored a price-to-earnings ratio above its average ratio, recording 16.56 x from its present earnings ratio. HST currently public float of 706.78M and currently shorts hold a 4.90% ratio of that float. The average price from analysts is $20.89, which is $2.26 above the current price."},
{"summary_text":"Toms Hardware spotted that RTX 4060 and 4050 models from Shangke Group  a Chinese firm that makes graphics cards, and other components too have been filed with the EEC (Eurasian Economic Commission) This is a hint that the Turing-based cards are perhaps closer to launch than the rumor mill has otherwise indicated."},
{"summary_text":"Discord update may throttle memory on Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia will release a fix soon, but also offers directions for manually rectifying the problem. It may have been the recent Discord patch that added the ability for streamers with RTX 40 series GPUs to encode using the AV1 codec."},
{"summary_text":"The latest version of Cyberpunk 2077 uses ray-traced shadows, reflections, diffuse illumination, and ambient occlusion. Dying Light 2: Stay Human has also received a DLSS 3 upgrade today. DLSS is short for Deep Learning Super Sampling. It uses artificial intelligent to get a higher frame rate for your PC game."},
{"summary_text":"N Nvidia has discovered a bug with the Discord application that will prevent the memory on even the best graphics cards from reaching its full speed. It's an intriguing bug since it affects Nvidia graphics cards only, more specifically, the memory subsystem. The chipmaker has stated it will push a fix for PC users with an over-the-air (OTA) update."},
{"summary_text":"Nvidias most frequent leaker, kopite7kimi, just shared the specifications of a rumored RTX 4090 Ti. Said to be even more powerful than the RTX 4080 Ti, it would surely top any ranking of the best graphics cards. But do we really want these two monstrous GPUs?"},
{"summary_text":"The new flagship Ada card will offer higher clocks, more CUDA cores and L2 cache. CUDA count will go from 16,384 to 18,176. Memory capacity will remain at 24GB, but Nvidia will swap out the existing 21Gb/s chips in favor of faster 24gb/s Micron dies. Boost clocks will probably approach 3GHz."},
{"summary_text":"N Nvidia's new flagship graphics card will use the AD102 graphics processor in a nearly full configuration. Power consumption of the new flagship will be up to 600W, according to the leaker, so expect it to feature an extremely sophisticated cooling system. It is unclear whether Nvidia plans to ever use AD102 with all of its stream processors enabled, since it's likely tough to find enough perfect GPUs."},
{"summary_text":"Pictures of what we assume will be NVIDIA's next-gen Titan graphics card have surfaced. The image lists 699-1G137 SKU as the card, confirming this. The overall design will make it the largest Founders Edition GPU to date. It also features a gold-colored cooler design, putting it in the Titan-class range for NVIDIA."},
{"summary_text":"The current plan is for the revamped flagship GPU to run with 18,176 CUDA Cores, along with 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM (running at 24Gbps), and a total board power usage of around 600W. This combines with another rumor from the weekend in which a second leaker on Twitter posted what is supposedly an image of the RTX Titan, which if correct will be a huge four-slot GPU."},
{"summary_text":"The 6600 XT is a more compelling choice, especially for those looking for high refresh rate competitive gaming at 1080p or 1440p. It offers better performance for a similar or lower price than the Nvidia RTX 3060. The extra cost did not justify the lack of features like DLSS and RT Cores, as well as a lower favorable memory configuration. However, if you are looking for a GPU that can handle high or maximum settings for AAA games, the Turing 3060 might make it worth the extra cost."},
